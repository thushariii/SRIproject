PMC7847520,A naturally derived small molecule NDSM253 inhibits IKK1 to suppress inflammation response and promote bone healing after fracture.,"Bone fracture induces an acute inflammatory response in the resident and peripheral monocyte/macrophage cells. Excessive amounts of proinflammatory cytokines can cause severe tissue damage and inhibit bone healing. The proinflammatory cytokine genes are mainly controlled by TLR4/NF-κB (Toll-like receptor 4/Nuclear factor κB). Thus, targeting the molecules in this signaling pathway to decrease the expression of proinflammatory cytokines is an effective strategy to inhibit the inflammatory response. Herein, we identified a naturally derived small molecule NDSM253 that specifically inhibited IKKα (Inhibitor of NF-κB kinase subunit-alpha), a critical component of TLR4/NF-κB signaling. Biochemically, NDMS253 decreased phosphorylation of IκB (Inhibitor of NF-κB), thereby increasing the binding of IκB-NF-κB and suppressing the proinflammatory cytokine gene expression. NDMS253 showed a much stronger inhibitory effect on proinflammatory cytokine gene expression than did the known IKK inhibitors, including ACHP (2-Amino-6-[2-(cyclopropylmethoxy)-6-hydroxyphenyl]-4-(4-piperidinyl)-3-pyridinecarbonitrile), IKK16, and Amlexanox. Administration of these IKK inhibitors in a mouse femoral fracture model showed that NDSM253 suppressed proinflammatory cytokine genes, thereby promoting bone healing, while the other three IKK inhibitors showed a weaker improvement of both bone healing and circulating proinflammatory cytokines. Collectively, our data suggested that NDSM253 might be an effective inhibitor of IKKα that could inhibit inflammatory cytokine action in bone injury.",O00206,XA,"['TLR4', 'Toll-like receptor 4', 'TOLL']",['XA'],[],[],"['TLR4', 'Toll-like receptor 4', 'TOLL']",['XA']

PMC3689961,IκB kinase β (IKKβ) inhibits p63 isoform γ (TAp63γ) transcriptional activity.,"Previously, we reported that IκB kinase-β(IKKβ) phosphorylates and stabilizes TAp63γ. However, the effect of this phosphorylation on TAp63γ transcriptional activity remains unclear. In this study, we showed that overexpression of IKKβ, but not its kinase dead mutant and IKKα, can surprisingly inhibit TAp63γ transcriptional activity as measured by luciferase assays and real-time PCR analyses of p63 target genes. This inhibition was impaired by ACHP, an IKKβ inhibitor, and enhanced by TNFα that activates IKKβ. Consistently, IKKβ inhibited the binding between TAp63γ and p300, a co-activator of TAp63γ, and consequently counteracted the positive effect of p300 on TAp63γ transcriptional activity. Through phosphorylation site prediction and mass spectrometry, we identified that Ser-4 and Ser-12 of p63 are IKKβ-targeting residues. As expected, IKKβ fails to suppress the transcriptional activity of the S4A/S12A double mutant p63. These results indicate that IKKβ can suppress TAp63γ activity by interfering with the interaction between TAp63γ and p300.",O14920,XA,['IKK-2'],['XA'],[],[],['IKK-2'],['XA']
PMC2679349,Protein kinase Cmu plays an essential role in hypertonicity-induced heat shock protein 70 expression.,"Heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), which evidences important functions as a molecular chaperone and anti-apoptotic molecule, is substantially induced in cells exposed to a variety of stresses, including hypertonic stress, heavy metals, heat shock, and oxidative stress, and prevents cellular damage under these conditions. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the induction of HSP70 in response to hypertonicity has been characterized to a far lesser extent. In this study, we have investigated the cellular signaling pathway of HSP70 induction under hypertonic conditions. Initially, we applied a variety of kinase inhibitors to NIH3T3 cells that had been exposed to hypertonicity. The induction of HSP70 was suppressed specifically by treatment with protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors (Gö6976 and GF109203X). As hypertonicity dramatically increased the phosphorylation of PKCmu, we then evaluated the role of PKCmu in hypertonicity-induced HSP70 expression and cell viability. The depletion of PKCmu with siRNA or the inhibition of PKCmu activity with inhibitors resulted in a reduction in HSP70 induction and cell viability. Tonicity-responsive enhancer binding protein (TonEBP), a transcription factor for hypertonicity-induced HSP70 expression, was translocated rapidly into the nucleus and was modified gradually in the nucleus under hypertonic conditions. When we administered treatment with PKC inhibitors, the mobility shift of TonEBP was affected in the nucleus. However, PKCmu evidenced no subcellular co-localization with TonEBP during hypertonic exposure. From our results, we have concluded that PKCmu performs a critical function in hypertonicity-induced HSP70 induction, and finally cellular protection, via the indirect regulation of TonEBP modification.",O94916,XA,"['Tonicity-responsive enhancer-binding protein', 'TonEBP']",['XA'],[],[],"['Tonicity-responsive enhancer-binding protein', 'TonEBP']",['XA']

PMC11145185,Inhibition of mRNA nuclear export promotes SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis.,"The nonstructural protein 1 (Nsp1) of SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2) is a virulence factor that targets multiple cellular pathways to inhibit host gene expression and antiviral response. However, the underlying mechanisms of the various Nsp1-mediated functions and their contributions to SARS-CoV-2 virulence remain unclear. Among the targets of Nsp1 is the mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid) export receptor NXF1-NXT1, which mediates nuclear export of mRNAs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Based on Nsp1 crystal structure, we generated mutants on Nsp1 surfaces and identified an acidic N-terminal patch that is critical for interaction with NXF1-NXT1. Photoactivatable Nsp1 probe reveals the RNA Recognition Motif (RRM) domain of NXF1 as an Nsp1 N-terminal binding site. By mutating the Nsp1 N-terminal acidic patch, we identified a separation-of-function mutant of Nsp1 that retains its translation inhibitory function but substantially loses its interaction with NXF1 and reverts Nsp1-mediated mRNA export inhibition. We then generated a recombinant (r)SARS-CoV-2 mutant on the Nsp1 N-terminal acidic patch and found that this surface is key to promote NXF1 binding and inhibition of host mRNA nuclear export, viral replication, and pathogenicity in vivo.

PMC3500442,Comparative genomics guided discovery of two missing archaeal enzyme families involved in the biosynthesis of the pterin moiety of tetrahydromethanopterin and tetrahydrofolate.,"C-1 carriers are essential cofactors in all domains of life, and in Archaea, these can be derivatives of tetrahydromethanopterin (H(4)-MPT) or tetrahydrofolate (H(4)-folate). Their synthesis requires 6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropterin diphosphate (6-HMDP) as the precursor, but the nature of pathways that lead to its formation were unknown until the recent discovery of the GTP cyclohydrolase IB/MptA family that catalyzes the first step, the conversion of GTP to dihydroneopterin 2',3'-cyclic phosphate or 7,8-dihydroneopterin triphosphate [El Yacoubi, B.; et al. (2006) J. Biol. Chem., 281, 37586-37593 and Grochowski, L. L.; et al. (2007) Biochemistry46, 6658-6667]. Using a combination of comparative genomics analyses, heterologous complementation tests, and in vitro assays, we show that the archaeal protein families COG2098 and COG1634 specify two of the missing 6-HMDP synthesis enzymes. Members of the COG2098 family catalyze the formation of 6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropterin from 7,8-dihydroneopterin, while members of the COG1634 family catalyze the formation of 6-HMDP from 6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropterin.

PMC2892419,Discovery and structure determination of the orphan enzyme isoxanthopterin deaminase .,"Two previously uncharacterized proteins have been identified that efficiently catalyze the deamination of isoxanthopterin and pterin 6-carboxylate. The genes encoding these two enzymes, NYSGXRC-9339a ( gi|44585104 ) and NYSGXRC-9236b ( gi|44611670 ), were first identified from DNA isolated from the Sargasso Sea as part of the Global Ocean Sampling Project. The genes were synthesized, and the proteins were subsequently expressed and purified. The X-ray structure of Sgx9339a was determined at 2.7 A resolution (Protein Data Bank entry 2PAJ ). This protein folds as a distorted (beta/alpha)(8) barrel and contains a single zinc ion in the active site. These enzymes are members of the amidohydrolase superfamily and belong to cog0402 within the clusters of orthologous groups (COG). Enzymes in cog0402 have previously been shown to catalyze the deamination of guanine, cytosine, S-adenosylhomocysteine, and 8-oxoguanine. A small compound library of pteridines, purines, and pyrimidines was used to probe catalytic activity. The only substrates identified in this search were isoxanthopterin and pterin 6-carboxylate. The kinetic constants for the deamination of isoxanthopterin with Sgx9339a were determined to be 1.0 s(-1), 8.0 muM, and 1.3 x 10(5) M(-1) s(-1) (k(cat), K(m), and k(cat)/K(m), respectively). The active site of Sgx9339a most closely resembles the active site for 8-oxoguanine deaminase (Protein Data Bank entry 2UZ9 ). A model for substrate recognition of isoxanthopterin by Sgx9339a was proposed on the basis of the binding of guanine and xanthine in the active site of guanine deaminase. Residues critical for substrate binding appear to be conserved glutamine and tyrosine residues that form hydrogen bonds with the carbonyl oxygen at C4, a conserved threonine residue that forms hydrogen bonds with N5, and another conserved threonine residue that forms hydrogen bonds with the carbonyl group at C7. These conserved active site residues were used to identify 24 other genes which are predicted to deaminate isoxanthopterin.",P00533,XA,['Genes'],"['XANTHOPTERIN', 'XA', 'XANTHOPTERIN']",[],[],['Genes'],"['XANTHOPTERIN', 'XA', 'XANTHOPTERIN']"

With the chemical carcinogenesis models, no mutations were detected in Egfr, which is in clear contrast to the high rates observed in either codon 12 or 61 of K-ras (21/23 of the lung tumors induced with NNK, 4/5 with MeIQx, 1/4 with urethane and 7/18 with BHP). However, in the X-ray-induced lung tumors, Egfr mutations with amino acid substitution were observed in exons 18 and 21 (4/12, 33%), but no activating mutation of K-ras was detected. In addition, one and four silent mutations were identified in K-ras (exon 1) and Egfr (exons 18, 20 and 21), respectively. Most mutations in both Egfr and K-ras were G/C-->A/T transitions (7/8, 88% and 31/34, 91%, respectively). Although, the mutational patterns in equivalent human lesions were not completely coincident, this first report of Egfr mutations in an experimental lung tumor model suggests that X-rays or other factors producing oxygen radicals could cause EGFR mutations in some proportion of lung cancers in humans.",P00533,XA,"['epidermal growth factor receptor', 'EGFR', 'epidermal growth factor receptor', 'Genes', 'Epidermal growth factor receptor', 'ERBB']",['XA'],['epidermal growth factor receptor'],[],"['EGFR', 'epidermal growth factor receptor', 'Genes', 'Epidermal growth factor receptor', 'ERBB']",['XA']

Asbestos exposure increases HER1-activity and expression in pre-clinical models. Additionally, HER1 over-expression is observed in the majority of MM cases. In this study, the utility of HER1-targeted chimeric IgG(1), cetuximab, and a human IgG(2), panitumumab, radiolabeled with (86)Y, were evaluated for PET imaging to detect MM non-invasively in vivo, and to select an antibody candidate for radioimmunotherapy (RIT).",P00533,XA,"['HER1', 'EGFR', 'epidermal growth factor receptor', 'Genes', 'HER1', 'Epidermal growth factor receptor', 'mENA']",['XA'],['HER1'],[],"['EGFR', 'epidermal growth factor receptor', 'Genes', 'HER1', 'Epidermal growth factor receptor', 'mENA']",['XA']
PMC99897,Transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) promotes endothelial cell survival during in vitro angiogenesis via an autocrine mechanism implicating TGF-alpha signaling.,"Mouse capillary endothelial cells (1G11 cell line) embedded in type I collagen gels undergo in vitro angiogenesis. Cells rapidly reorganize and form capillary-like structures when stimulated with serum. Transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) alone can substitute for serum and induce cell survival and tubular network formation. This TGF-beta1-mediated angiogenic activity depends on phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. We showed that specific inhibitors of either pathway (wortmannin, LY-294002, and PD-98059) all suppressed TGF-beta1-induced angiogenesis mainly by compromising cell survival. We established that TGF-beta1 stimulated the expression of TGF-alpha mRNA and protein, the tyrosine phosphorylation of a 170-kDa membrane protein representing the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor, and the delayed activation of PI3K/Akt and p42/p44 MAPK. Moreover, we showed that all these TGF-beta1-mediated signaling events, including tubular network formation, were suppressed by incubating TGF-beta1-stimulated endothelial cells with a soluble form of an EGF receptor (ErbB-1) or tyrphostin AG1478, a specific blocker of EGF receptor tyrosine kinase. Finally, addition of TGF-alpha alone poorly stimulated angiogenesis; however, by reducing cell death, it strongly potentiated the action of TGF-beta1. We therefore propose that TGF-beta1 promotes angiogenesis at least in part via the autocrine secretion of TGF-alpha, a cell survival growth factor, activating PI3K/Akt and p42/p44 MAPK.",P00533,XA,"['EGFR', 'erbB-1', 'Genes', 'ERBB']",['XA'],[],[],"['EGFR', 'erbB-1', 'Genes', 'ERBB']",['XA']

PMC4485619,Steric and electronic control over the reactivity of a thiolate-ligated Fe(II) complex with dioxygen and superoxide: reversible mu-oxo dimer formation.,"The reactivity between a thiolate-ligated five-coordinate complex [FeII(SMe2N4(tren))]+ (1) and dioxygen is examined in order to determine if O2 activation, resembling that of the metalloenzyme cytochrome P450, can be promoted even when O2 binds cis, as opposed to trans, to a thiolate. Previous work in our group showed that [FeII(SMe2N4(tren))]+ (1) reacts readily with superoxide (O2-) in the presence of a proton source to afford H2O2 via an Fe(III)-OOH intermediate, thus providing a biomimetic model for the metalloenzyme superoxide reductase (SOR). Addition of O2 to 1 affords binuclear mu-oxo-bridged [FeIII(SMe2N4(tren))]2(mu2-O)(PF6)2.3MeCN (3). At low temperatures, in protic solvents, an intermediate is detected, the details of which will be the subject of a separate paper. Although the thiolate ligand does not appear to perturb the metrical parameters of the unsupported mu-oxo bridge (Fe-O= 1.807(8) A, and Fe-O-Fe= 155.3(5) degrees fall in the usual range), it decreases the magnetic coupling between the irons (J=-28 cm(-1)) and creates a rather basic oxo site. Protonation of this oxo using strong (HBF4, HCl) or weak (HOAc, NH4PF6, LutNHCl) acids results in bridge cleavage to cleanly afford the corresponding monomeric anion-ligated (OAc- (6), or Cl- (7)) or solvent-ligated (MeCN (4)) derivatives. Addition of OH- converts [FeIII(SMe2N4(tren))(MeCN2+ (4) back to mu-oxo 3. Thus, mu-oxo bridge cleavage is reversible. The protonated mu-hydroxo-bridged intermediate is not observed. In an attempt to prevent mu-oxo dimer formation, and facilitate the observation of O2-bound intermediates, a bulkier tertiary amine ligand, tren-Et4= N-(2-amino-ethyl)-N-(2-diethylamino-ethyl)-N',N'-diethyl-ethane-1,2-diamine, and the corresponding [FeII(SMe2N4(tren-Et4))]+ (5) complex was synthesized and structurally characterized. Steric repulsive interactions create unusually long FeII-N(3,4) amine bonds in 5 (mean distance=2.219(1) A). The [(tren-Et4)N4SMe2]1- ligand is unable to accommodate iron in the +3 oxidation state, and consequently, in contrast to most thiolate-ligated Fe(II) complexes, [FeII(SMe2N4(tren-Et4))]+ (5) does not readily react with O2. Oxidation of 5 is irreversible, and the potential (Epa=+410 mV (vs SCE)) is anodically shifted relative to 1 (E1/2=-100 mV (vs SCE)).",P01033,XA,['EPA'],"['XA', 'XA']",[],['XA'],['EPA'],['XA']
PMC7432763,Drug Discovery Targeting the Disorder-To-Order Transition Regions through the Conformational Diversity Mimicking and Statistical Analysis.,"Intrinsically disordered proteins exist as highly dynamic conformational ensembles of diverse forms. However, the majority of virtual screening only focuses on proteins with defined structures. This means that computer-aided drug discovery is restricted. As a breakthrough, understanding the structural characteristics of intrinsically disordered proteins and its application can open the gate for unrestricted drug discovery. First, we segmented the target disorder-to-order transition region into a series of overlapping 20-amino-acid-long peptides. Folding prediction generated diverse conformations of these peptides. Next, we applied molecular docking, new evaluation score function, and statistical analysis. This approach successfully distinguished known compounds and their corresponding binding regions. Especially, Myc proto-oncogene protein (MYC) inhibitor 10058F4 was well distinguished from others of the chemical compound library. We also studied differences between the two Methyl-CpG-binding domain protein 2 (MBD2) inhibitors (ABA (2-amino-N-[[(3S)-2,3-dihydro-1,4-benzodioxin-3-yl]methyl]-acetamide) and APC ((R)-(3-(2-Amino-acetylamino)-pyrrolidine-1-carboxylic acid tert-butyl ester))). Both compounds bind MBD2 through electrostatic interaction behind its p66α-binding site. ABA is also able to bind p66α through electrostatic interaction behind its MBD2-binding site while APC-p66α binding was nonspecific. Therefore, structural heterogeneity mimicking of the disorder-to-order transition region at the peptide level and utilization of the new docking score function represent a useful approach that can efficiently discriminate compounds for expanded virtual screening toward intrinsically disordered proteins.",P01106,XA,['Myc proto-oncogene protein'],['XA'],[],[],['Myc proto-oncogene protein'],['XA']

PMC508843,Fluid shear stress activation of egr-1 transcription in cultured human endothelial and epithelial cells is mediated via the extracellular signal-related kinase 1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway.,"The primary response transcription factor, early growth response-1 (Egr-1), is rapidly activated by a variety of extracellular stimuli. Egr-1 binds to a sequence found in the promoters of genes involved in vascular injury, such as PDGF-A and tissue factor, and trans-activates their expression in endothelial cells in response to fluid shear stress. Here we show that egr-1 mRNA is increased after 30 min of flow in human aortic endothelial cell and HeLa cell cultures. Transient transfection of HeLa cells with reporter gene constructs driven by the murine or human egr-1 5' flanking sequence revealed a five- and ninefold induction, respectively, in transcriptional activity after exposure to a shear stress of 5 dynes/cm2 for 3 h. Deletion of sequences in the murine promoter containing two AP1 sites and an inhibitory Egr-1 binding sequence, did not reduce shear stress inducibility. However, progressive deletion of five serum response elements, reduced both the basal promoter activity and its capacity to be activated by shear stress. Further examination indicated that the three upstream serum response elements are predominantly responsible for shear stress activation of the egr-1 promoter. Treatment of cells with PD98059, a specific inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase-1 inhibited shear stress activation of egr-1. We suggest that egr-1 activation by shear stress involves activation of Elk-1 but not c-jun activity. These data, which are consistent with previous findings for shear mediated signaling via the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade, now implicate shear modulation of the Egr-1 transcription factor in this pathway.",P04085,XA,['PDGF-A'],['XA'],[],[],['PDGF-A'],['XA']

Several mechanisms responsible for in vitro cytotoxicity have been proposed. These include the penetration of nZnO into the cytoplasm, generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) that degrade mitochondrial function, induce endoplasmic reticulum stress, and damage deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), lipid, and protein molecules. Otherwise, nZnO dissolve extracellularly into zinc ions and the subsequent diffusion of ions into the cytoplasm can create ROS. Furthermore, internalization of nZnO and localization in acidic lysosomes result in their dissolution into zinc ions, producing ROS too in cytoplasm. These ROS-mediated responses induce caspase-dependent apoptosis via the activation of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2), Bcl2-associated X protein (Bax), CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (chop), and phosphoprotein p53 gene expressions.

Their synthesis requires 6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropterin diphosphate (6-HMDP) as the precursor, but the nature of pathways that lead to its formation were unknown until the recent discovery of the GTP cyclohydrolase IB/MptA family that catalyzes the first step, the conversion of GTP to dihydroneopterin 2',3'-cyclic phosphate or 7,8-dihydroneopterin triphosphate [El Yacoubi, B.; et al.

PMC2892419,Discovery and structure determination of the orphan enzyme isoxanthopterin deaminase .,"Two previously uncharacterized proteins have been identified that efficiently catalyze the deamination of isoxanthopterin and pterin 6-carboxylate. The genes encoding these two enzymes, NYSGXRC-9339a ( gi|44585104 ) and NYSGXRC-9236b ( gi|44611670 ), were first identified from DNA isolated from the Sargasso Sea as part of the Global Ocean Sampling Project. The genes were synthesized, and the proteins were subsequently expressed and purified. The X-ray structure of Sgx9339a was determined at 2.7 A resolution (Protein Data Bank entry 2PAJ ). This protein folds as a distorted (beta/alpha)(8) barrel and contains a single zinc ion in the active site. These enzymes are members of the amidohydrolase superfamily and belong to cog0402 within the clusters of orthologous groups (COG). Enzymes in cog0402 have previously been shown to catalyze the deamination of guanine, cytosine, S-adenosylhomocysteine, and 8-oxoguanine. A small compound library of pteridines, purines, and pyrimidines was used to probe catalytic activity. The only substrates identified in this search were isoxanthopterin and pterin 6-carboxylate. The kinetic constants for the deamination of isoxanthopterin with Sgx9339a were determined to be 1.0 s(-1), 8.0 muM, and 1.3 x 10(5) M(-1) s(-1) (k(cat), K(m), and k(cat)/K(m), respectively). The active site of Sgx9339a most closely resembles the active site for 8-oxoguanine deaminase (Protein Data Bank entry 2UZ9 ). A model for substrate recognition of isoxanthopterin by Sgx9339a was proposed on the basis of the binding of guanine and xanthine in the active site of guanine deaminase. Residues critical for substrate binding appear to be conserved glutamine and tyrosine residues that form hydrogen bonds with the carbonyl oxygen at C4, a conserved threonine residue that forms hydrogen bonds with N5, and another conserved threonine residue that forms hydrogen bonds with the carbonyl group at C7.

PMC11048093,Postnatal Growth and Development of the Rumen: Integrating Physiological and Molecular Insights.,"The rumen plays an essential role in the physiology and production of agriculturally important ruminants such as cattle. Functions of the rumen include fermentation, absorption, metabolism, and protection. Cattle are, however, not born with a functional rumen, and the rumen undergoes considerable changes in size, histology, physiology, and transcriptome from birth to adulthood. In this review, we discuss these changes in detail, the factors that affect these changes, and the potential molecular and cellular mechanisms that mediate these changes. The introduction of solid feed to the rumen is essential for rumen growth and functional development in post-weaning calves.

PMC5288139,Agonistic analogs of growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH) promote wound healing by stimulating the proliferation and survival of human dermal fibroblasts through ERK and AKT pathways.,"Decreased or impaired proliferation capability of dermal fibroblasts interferes with successful wound healing. Several growth factors tested failed to fully restore the growth of fibroblasts, possibly due to their rapid degradation by proteases. It is therefore critical to find new agents which have stimulatory effects on fibroblasts while being highly resistant to degradation. In such a scenario, the activities of two agonistic analogs of growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH), MR-409 and MR-502, were evaluated for their impact on proliferation and survival of primary human dermal fibroblasts. In vitro, both analogs significantly stimulated cell growth by more than 50%. Under serum-depletion induced stress, fibroblasts treated with MR-409 or MR-502 demonstrated better survival rates than control. These effects can be inhibited by either PD98059 or wortmannin. Signaling through MEK/ERK1/2 and PI3K/AKT in an IGF-1 receptor-independent manner is required. In vivo, MR-409 promoted wound closure. Animals treated topically with MR-409 healed earlier than controls in a dose-dependent manner. Histologic examination revealed better wound contraction and less fibrosis in treated groups. In conclusion, MR-409 is a potent mitogenic and anti-apoptotic factor for primary human dermal fibroblasts. Its beneficial effects on wound healing make it a promising agent for future development.",P05019,XA,"['IGF1', 'IGF', 'Insulin-like growth factor I', 'IGF-I']",['XA'],[],[],"['IGF1', 'IGF', 'Insulin-like growth factor I', 'IGF-I']",['XA']

Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) of the gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) system comprise a heterogeneous group of tumors with increasing incidence and poor prognosis. Here, we report the antiproliferative effects of the HSP90 inhibitors AUY922 and HSP990 in neuroendocrine tumor cells. Treatment of human pancreatic BON1, bronchopulmonary NCI-H727 and midgut carcinoid GOT1 neuroendocrine tumor cells with increasing concentrations of AUY922 and HSP990 dose-dependently suppressed cell viability. Significant effects on neuroendocrine cell viability were observed with inhibitor concentrations as low as 5 nM. Inhibition of cell viability was associated with the induction of apoptosis as demonstrated by an increase in sub-G1 events and PARP cleavage. HSP90 inhibition was associated with decreased neuroendocrine ErbB and IGF-I receptor expression, decreased Erk and Akt phospho-rylation and the induction of HSP70 expression. These findings provide evidence that targeted inhibition of upregulated HSP90 activity could be useful for the treatment of aggressive neuroendocrine tumors resistant to conventional therapy.",P05019,XA,"['IGF', 'IGFI', 'IGF-I']",['XA'],[],[],"['IGF', 'IGFI', 'IGF-I']",['XA']

Compared to wild-type counterparts, Zeb1-deficient injured muscles exhibit enhanced damage that corresponds with a retarded p38-MAPK-dependent transition of their macrophages towards an anti-inflammatory phenotype. Zeb1-deficient injured muscles also display a delayed and poorer regeneration that is accounted by the retarded anti-inflammatory macrophage transition and their intrinsically deficient muscle satellite cells (MuSCs). Macrophages in Zeb1-deficient injured muscles show lower phosphorylation of p38 and its forced activation reverts the enhanced muscle damage and poorer regeneration. MuSCs require ZEB1 to maintain their quiescence, prevent their premature activation following injury, and drive efficient regeneration in dystrophic muscles.

PMC4705462,Increased nuclear stiffness via FAK-ERK1/2 signaling is necessary for synthetic mechano-growth factor E peptide-induced tenocyte migration.,"We have previously reported that a synthetic mechano-growth factor (MGF) C-terminal E-domain with 25 amino acids (MGF-C25E) promotes rat tenocyte migration through the FAK-ERK1/2 signaling pathway. However, the role of the nucleus in MGF-C25E-promoted tenocyte migration and the molecular mechanisms involved remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that MGF-C25E increases the Young's modulus of tenocytes through the FAK-ERK1/2 signaling pathway. This increase is not accompanied by an obvious change in the expression of Lamin A/C but is accompanied by significant chromatin condensation, indicating that MGF-C25E-induced chromatin condensation may contribute to the increased nuclear stiffness. Moreover, DNA methylation is observed in MGF-C25E-treated tenocytes. Inhibition of DNA methylation suppresses the elevation in chromatin condensation, in nuclear stiffness, and in tenocyte migration induced by MGF-C25E. The inhibition of the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) or extracellular signal regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) signals represses MGF-C25E-promoted DNA methylation. It also abolishes chromatin condensation, nuclear stiffness, and cell migration. Taken together, our results suggest that MGF-C25E promotes tenocyte migration by increasing nuclear stiffness via the FAK-ERK1/2 signaling pathway. This provides strong evidence for the role of nuclear mechanics in tenocyte migration and new insight into the molecular mechanisms of MGF-promoted tenocyte migration.",P05019,XA,"['IGF', 'Mechano growth factor', 'Insulin-like growth factor I', 'IGF-I', 'MGF']",['XA'],[],[],"['IGF', 'Mechano growth factor', 'Insulin-like growth factor I', 'IGF-I', 'MGF']",['XA']

In our study, we investigated the role of long non-coding RNA taurine-upregulated gene 1 (TUG1) in regulating microglial glucose metabolism reprogramming and activation. BV2 cells were treated with Lipopolysaccharides (LPS)/Interferon-γ (IFN-γ) to establish a microglial activation model. The glycolysis inhibitor 2-Deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) was used as a control. The expression levels of TUG1 mRNA and proinflammatory cytokines such as Interleukin-1β (IL-1β), Interleukin -6, and Tumor Necrosis Factor-α mRNA and anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, Arginase 1(Arg1), CD206, and Ym1 were detected by RT-qPCR. TUG1 was silenced using TUG1 siRNA and knocked out using CRISPR/Cas9. The mRNA and protein expression levels of key enzymes involved in glucose metabolism, such as Hexokinase2, Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), Lactate dehydrogenase, Glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase, and Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), were determined by RT-qPCR and Western blotting. The glycolytic rate of microglial cells was measured using Seahorse. Differential metabolites were determined by metabolomics, and pathway enrichment was performed using these differential metabolites. Our findings revealed that the expression of TUG1 was elevated in proinflammatory-activated microglia and positively correlated with the levels of inflammatory factors. The expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, Arg1, CD206, and Ym1 were decreased when induced with LPS/IFN-γ. However, this decrease was reversed by the treatment with 2-DG. Silencing of GAPDH led to an increase in the expression of TUG1 and inflammatory factors. TUG1 knockout (TUG1KO) inhibited the expression of glycolytic key enzymes and promoted the expression of oxidative phosphorylation key enzymes, shifting the metabolic profile of activated microglia from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation. Additionally, TUG1KO reduced the accumulation of metabolites, facilitating the restoration of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and enhancing oxidative phosphorylation in microglia. Furthermore, the downregulation of TUG1 was found to reduce the expression of both proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines under normal conditions. Interestingly, when induced with LPS/IFN-γ, TUG1 downregulation showed a potentially beneficial effect on microglia in terms of inflammation.

We cross-sectionally analysed associations between twelve B vitamins and one-carbon metabolites and ten inflammation and angiogenesis biomarkers from pre-surgery serum samples using multivariable linear regression models.

PMC3959821,Hsp90 inhibition protects against inherited retinal degeneration.,"The molecular chaperone Hsp90 is important for the functional maturation of many client proteins, and inhibitors are in clinical trials for multiple indications in cancer. Hsp90 inhibition activates the heat shock response and can improve viability in a cell model of the P23H misfolding mutation in rhodopsin that causes autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP). Here, we show that a single low dose of the Hsp90 inhibitor HSP990 enhanced visual function and delayed photoreceptor degeneration in a P23H transgenic rat model. This was associated with the induction of heat shock protein expression and reduced rhodopsin aggregation. We then investigated the effect of Hsp90 inhibition on a different type of rod opsin mutant, R135L, which is hyperphosphorylated, binds arrestin and disrupts vesicular traffic. Hsp90 inhibition with 17-AAG reduced the intracellular accumulation of R135L and abolished arrestin binding in cells. Hsf-1(-/-) cells revealed that the effect of 17-AAG on P23H aggregation was dependent on HSF-1, whereas the effect on R135L was HSF-1 independent. Instead, the effect on R135L was mediated by a requirement of Hsp90 for rhodopsin kinase (GRK1) maturation and function. Importantly, Hsp90 inhibition restored R135L rod opsin localization to wild-type (WT) phenotype in vivo in rat retina. Prolonged Hsp90 inhibition with HSP990 in vivo led to a posttranslational reduction in GRK1 and phosphodiesterase (PDE6) protein levels, identifying them as Hsp90 clients. These data suggest that Hsp90 represents a potential therapeutic target for different types of rhodopsin adRP through distinct mechanisms, but also indicate that sustained Hsp90 inhibition might adversely affect visual function.",P05231,XA,['HSF'],['XA'],[],[],['HSF'],['XA']
PMC10669250,A Network Pharmacology and Molecular-Docking-Based Approach to Identify the Probable Targets of Short-Chain Fatty-Acid-Producing Microbial Metabolites against Kidney Cancer and Inflammation.,"(1) Background: A large and diverse microbial population exists in the human intestinal tract, which supports gut homeostasis and the health of the host. Short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-secreting microbes also generate several metabolites with favorable regulatory effects on various malignancies and immunological inflammations. The involvement of intestinal SCFAs in kidney diseases, such as various kidney malignancies and inflammations, has emerged as a fascinating area of study in recent years. However, the mechanisms of SCFAs and other metabolites produced by SCFA-producing bacteria against kidney cancer and inflammation have not yet been investigated. (2) Methods: We considered 177 different SCFA-producing microbial species and 114 metabolites from the gutMgene database. Further, we used different online-based database platforms to predict 1890 gene targets associated with metabolites. Moreover, DisGeNET, OMIM, and Genecard databases were used to consider 13,104 disease-related gene targets. We used a Venn diagram and various protein-protein interactions (PPIs), KEGG pathways, and GO analyses for the functional analysis of gene targets. Moreover, the subnetwork of protein-protein interactions (through string and cytoscape platforms) was used to select the top 20% of gene targets through degree centrality, betweenness centrality, and closeness centrality. To screen the possible candidate compounds, we performed an analysis of the ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity) properties of metabolites and then found the best binding affinity using molecular docking simulation. (3) Results: Finally, we found the key gene targets that interact with suitable compounds and function against kidney cancer and inflammation, such as MTOR (with glycocholic acid), PIK3CA (with 11-methoxycurvularin, glycocholic acid, and isoquercitrin), IL6 (with isoquercitrin), PTGS2 (with isoquercitrin), and IGF1R (with 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b] pyridine, isoquercitrin), showed a lower binding affinity.

PMC6082394,Synthesis of interleukin 1 beta and interleukin 6 in human lymphocytes is stimulated by tributyltin.,"Tributyltin (TBT) is a widespread environmental contaminant that is present in human blood and other tissues. It has been shown to disrupt the immune function of human natural killer (NK) cells and to alter the secretion of a number of pro-inflammatory cytokines from immune cells. Secretion of both interleukin 1β (IL-1β) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) from human lymphocytes can be increased dependent upon the level of TBT exposure. This study shows that the TBT-induced increases in secretion of both cytokines are due to TBT-induced increases in the synthesis of these proteins and not simply because of the release of pre-existing cytokine. Furthermore, the data indicate that these TBT-induced increases in IL-1β and IL-6 synthesis require MAP kinase signaling pathways. Additionally, elevated synthesis of IL-1β and IL-6 seen at the highest exposures to TBT (200, 200, 50 nM) were accompanied by increases in the mRNA for these cytokines. TBT-induced increases in IL-1β and IL-6 mRNAs were also shown to be dependent on MAP kinase signaling. The study suggests that TBT has the capacity to increase immune cell production of these 2 important pro-inflammatory cytokines and that this increase is in part explained by increased mRNA for the cytokines.",P05231,XA,"['Interleukin-6', 'interleukin 6', 'IL-6']",['XA'],[],[],"['Interleukin-6', 'interleukin 6', 'IL-6']",['XA']

PMC1571874,The effects of heparin and related molecules upon the adhesion of human polymorphonuclear leucocytes to vascular endothelium in vitro.,"1. The effects of an unfractionated heparin preparation (Multiparin), a low molecular weight heparin preparation (Fragmin) and a selectively O-desulphated derivative of heparin lacking anticoagulant activity, have been investigated for their effects on the adhesion of human polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMNs) to cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in vitro. The effect of poly-L-glutamic acid, a large, polyanionic molecule was also studied. 2. Unfractionated heparin (50-1000 U ml-1), the O-desulphated derivative (0.3-6 mg ml-1) and the low molecular weight heparin (50 U-1000 U ml-1) all inhibited significantly the adhesion of 51Cr labelled PMNs to HUVECs stimulated with interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta; 10 U ml-1), bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 2.5 micrograms ml-1) or tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha; 125 U ml-1) for 6 h, whereas poly-L-glutamic acid had no effect. In addition, the three heparin preparations in the same concentration range inhibited significantly the adhesion of f-met-leu-phe-stimulated PMNs to resting HUVECs. 3. The effects of unfractionated heparin upon the expression of adhesion molecules intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and E-selection were also investigated, as were the effects of unfractionated heparin upon adhesion of human PMNs to previously stimulated HUVECs. Heparin had little effect upon levels of expression of these adhesion molecules on stimulated HUVECs. However, a profound effect upon PMN adhesion to previously stimulated HUVECs was demonstrated using the same preparation, suggesting that inhibition of adhesion molecule expression is not a major component of the described inhibitory effects of heparin. 4. Pre-incubation of PMNs with heparin followed by washing inhibited their adhesion to HUVECs, under different conditions of cellular activation, implying that heparin can bind to these cells and exert its anti-adhesive effects even when not directly present in the system. 5. These observations would suggest that both heparin and a low molecular weight heparin are capable of inhibiting adhesion of human PMNs to endothelial cells, an effect not dependent solely upon the polyanionic nature of these molecules, nor dependent upon their ability to act as anticoagulants.",P05362,PGA,['ICAM-1'],['PGA'],[],[],['ICAM-1'],['PGA']

PMC4837236,Interleukin-21 induces migration and invasion of fibroblast-like synoviocytes from patients with rheumatoid arthritis.,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by synovial fibroblast hyperplasia and bone erosion. Fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) play a pivotal role in RA pathogenesis through aggressive migration and matrix invasion, and certain proinflammatory cytokines may affect synoviocyte invasion. Whether interleukin (IL)-21 influences this process remains controversial. Here, we evaluated the potential regulatory effect of IL-21 on the migration, invasion and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression in RA-FLS. We found that IL-21 promoted the migration, invasion and MMP (MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-9, MMP-13) production in RA-FLS. Moreover, IL-21 induced activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT-3) and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) pathways, and blockage of these pathways [PI3K/protein kinase B (AKT) inhibitor LY294002, STAT-3 inhibitor STA-21 and ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059] attenuated IL-21-induced migration and secretion of MMP-3 and MMP-9.

The present study shows 4R decreased brain damage in rodent ischemic stroke models. The 4R-pretreated mice had lower infarct volumes (26.2±9.7 mm3) than those in control groups (untreated: 63.4±4.2 mm3, DMSO: 60.2±14.2 mm3). The 4R-posttreated rats also had less infarct volumes (120±65 mm3) than those in the rats of the DMSO group (291±95 mm3). The results from in vitro experiments indicate that 4R decreased neuro2a cell (neuroblastoma cells) apoptosis induced by oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD), and improved the population spikes' (PSs) recovery in rat acute hippocampal slices under OGD; a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, wortmannin, abolished the effect of 4R on PSs recovery. Furthermore, 4R also inhibited monocyte adhesion to murine brain-derived endothelial (bEND5) cells and upregulation of intercellular adhesion molecule-1(ICAM-1) induced by OGD/reoxygenation (OGD/R), and restored the p-Akt level to pre-OGD/R values in bEND5 cells.

PMC231885,"Antiapoptotic signalling by the insulin-like growth factor I receptor, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and Akt.","We have found that insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) can protect fibroblasts from apoptosis induced by UV-B light. Antiapoptotic signalling by the IGF-I receptor depended on receptor kinase activity, as cells overexpressing kinase-defective receptor mutants could not be protected by IGF-I. Overexpression of a kinase-defective receptor which contained a mutation in the ATP binding loop functioned as a dominant negative and sensitized cells to apoptosis. The antiapoptotic capacity of the IGF-I receptor was not shared by other growth factors tested, including epidermal growth factor (EGF) and thrombin, although the cells expressed functional receptors for all the agonists. However, EGF was antiapoptotic for cells overexpressing the EGF receptor, and expression of activated pp60v-src also was protective. There was no correlation between protection from apoptosis and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase, p38/HOG1, or p70S6 kinase. On the other hand, protection by any of the tyrosine kinases against UV-induced apoptosis was blocked by wortmannin, implying a role for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3 kinase). To test this, we transiently expressed constitutively active or kinase-dead PI3 kinase and found that overexpression of activated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3 kinase) was sufficient to provide protection against apoptosis. Because Akt/PKB is believed to be a downstream effector for PI3 kinase, we also examined the role of this serine/threonine protein kinase in antiapoptotic signalling. We found that membrane-targeted Akt was sufficient to protect against apoptosis but that kinase-dead Akt was not. We conclude that the endogenous IGF-I receptor has a specific antiapoptotic signalling capacity, that overexpression of other tyrosine kinases can allow them also to be antiapoptotic, and that activation of PI3 kinase and Akt is sufficient for antiapoptotic signalling.",P08069,XA,"['Insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor', 'IGF-I receptor', 'Insulin-like growth factor I receptor']",['XA'],['Insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor'],[],"['IGF-I receptor', 'Insulin-like growth factor I receptor']",['XA']

In the present study, we investigated the effect of basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2) on osteoprotegerin (OPG) synthesis in osteoblast-like MC3T3-E1 cells and whether resveratrol affects the OPG synthesis. FGF-2 stimulated both the OPG release and the expression of OPG mRNA. Resveratrol significantly suppressed the FGF-2-stimulated OPG release and the mRNA levels of OPG. SRT1720, an activator of SIRT1, reduced the FGF-2-induced OPG release and the OPG mRNA expression. PD98059, an inhibitor of upstream kinase activating p44/p42 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase, had little effect on the FGF-2-stimulated OPG release. On the other hand, SB203580, an inhibitor of p38 MAP kinase, SP600125, an inhibitor of stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK), and Akt inhibitor suppressed the OPG release induced by FGF-2. Resveratrol failed to affect the FGF-2-induced phosphorylation of p44/p42 MAP kinase, p38 MAP kinase or SAPK/JNK. The phosphorylation of Akt induced by FGF-2 was significantly suppressed by resveratrol or SRT1720.

PMC3049152,Cerebral arterial stenoses and stroke: novel features of Aicardi-Goutières syndrome caused by the Arg164X mutation in SAMHD1 are associated with altered cytokine expression.,"Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS) is a rare inborn multisystemic disease, resembling intrauterine viral infection and resulting in psychomotor retardation, spasticity and chilblain-likeskin lesions. Diagnostic criteria include intracerebral calcifications and elevated interferon-alpha and pterin levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We report on four adult siblings with unknown neurodegenerative disease presenting with cerebrovascular stenoses, stroke and glaucoma in childhood, two of whom died at the age of 40 and 29 years. Genome-wide homozygosity mapping identified 170 candidate genes embedded in a common haplotype of 8Mb on chromosome 20q11-13. Next generation sequencing of the entire region identified the c.490C>T (p.Arg164X) mutationin SAMHD1, a gene most recently described in AGS, on both alleles in all affected siblings.Clinical diagnosis of AGS was then confirmed by demonstrating intracerebral calcifications on cranial computed tomography in all siblings and elevated pterin levels in CSF in three of them. Inpatient fibroblasts, lack of SAMHD1 protein expression was associated with increased basal expression of IL8, while stimulated expression of IFNB1 was reduced. We conclude that cerebrovascular stenoses and stroke associated with the Arg164X mutation in SAMHD1 extend the phenotypic spectrum of AGS. The observed vascular changes most likely reflect a vasculitis caused by dysregulated inflammatory stress response.",P10145,Pterin,"['IL-8', 'Interleukin-8', 'IL8', 'NAF', 'LECT']","['Pterin', 'Pterine', 'Pterin', 'Pterin', 'Pterine']",[],[],"['IL-8', 'Interleukin-8', 'IL8', 'NAF', 'LECT']","['Pterin', 'Pterine', 'Pterin', 'Pterin', 'Pterine']"
PMC8525858,Small-molecule Akt-activation in airway cells induces NO production and reduces IL-8 transcription through Nrf-2.,"The non-cancerous functions of Akt in the airway are understudied. In some tissues, Akt phosphorylates and activates endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) to produce nitric oxide (NO) that has anti-inflammatory effects. NO production has antibacterial and antiviral effects in the airway, and increasing NO may be a useful anti-pathogen strategy. Akt also stimulates the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2) transcription factor, which transcribes antioxidant genes. Therefore, we hypothesized that activation of the Akt/eNOS pathway, which also activates Nrf-2, may have protective effects in human airway cells against injury.",P10145,XA,"['IL-8', 'IL-8', 'Interleukin-8', 'IL8', 'LECT']",['XA'],['IL-8'],[],"['IL-8', 'Interleukin-8', 'IL8', 'LECT']",['XA']
PMC4694011,Activation of the Classical Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases Is Part of the Shiga Toxin-Induced Ribotoxic Stress Response and May Contribute to Shiga Toxin-Induced Inflammation.,"Infection with enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) can result in severe disease, including hemorrhagic colitis and the hemolytic uremic syndrome. Shiga toxins (Stx) are the key EHEC virulence determinant contributing to severe disease. Despite inhibiting protein synthesis, Shiga toxins paradoxically induce the expression of proinflammatory cytokines from various cell types in vitro, including intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). This effect is mediated in large part by the ribotoxic stress response (RSR). The Shiga toxin-induced RSR is known to involve the activation of the stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs) p38 and JNK. In some cell types, Stx also can induce the classical mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) or ERK1/2, but the mechanism(s) by which this activation occurs is unknown. In this study, we investigated the mechanism by which Stx activates ERK1/2s in IECs and the contribution of ERK1/2 activation to interleukin-8 (IL-8) expression. We demonstrate that Stx1 activates ERK1/2 in a biphasic manner: the first phase occurs in response to StxB1 subunit, while the second phase requires StxA1 subunit activity. We show that the A subunit-dependent ERK1/2 activation is mediated through ZAK-dependent signaling, and inhibition of ERK1/2 activation via the MEK1/2 inhibitors U0126 and PD98059 results in decreased Stx1-mediated IL-8 mRNA. Finally, we demonstrate that ERK1/2 are activated in vivo in the colon of Stx2-intoxicated infant rabbits, a model in which Stx2 induces a primarily neutrophilic inflammatory response. Together, our data support a role for ERK1/2 activation in the development of Stx-mediated intestinal inflammation.",P10145,XA,"['IL-8', 'Interleukin-8', 'NAF', 'LECT']",['XA'],[],[],"['IL-8', 'Interleukin-8', 'NAF', 'LECT']",['XA']

PMC5363410,Increased Expression of Laminin Subunit Alpha 1 Chain by dCas9-VP160.,"Laminin-111 protein complex links the extracellular matrix to integrin α7β1 in sarcolemma, thus replacing in dystrophic muscles links normally insured by the dystrophin complex. Laminin-111 injection in mdx mouse stabilized sarcolemma, restored serum creatine kinase to wild-type levels, and protected muscles from exercised-induced damages. These results suggested that increased laminin-111 is a potential therapy for DMD. Laminin subunit beta 1 and laminin subunit gamma 1 are expressed in adult human muscle, but laminin subunit alpha 1 (LAMA1) gene is expressed only during embryogenesis. We thus developed an alternative method to laminin-111 protein repeated administration by inducing expression of the endogenous mouse Lama1 gene. This was done with the CRSPR/Cas9 system, i.e., by targeting the Lama1 promoter with one or several gRNAs and a dCas9 coupled with the VP160 transcription activation domain.

Marked dilation of distal tubules and collecting ducts was observed by 4 days with phenol II treatment, but the morphology returned to normal after 7 days of subsequent normal diet. Staining of tissue sections with two mouse monoclonal antibodies to a recently described basement membrane chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (BM-CSPG) core protein was markedly diminished in the basement membranes of dilated cystic tubules.

PMC6434033,ZEB1 protects skeletal muscle from damage and is required for its regeneration.,"The mechanisms linking muscle injury and regeneration are not fully understood. Here we report an unexpected role for ZEB1 regulating inflammatory and repair responses in dystrophic and acutely injured muscles. ZEB1 is upregulated in the undamaged and regenerating myofibers of injured muscles. Compared to wild-type counterparts, Zeb1-deficient injured muscles exhibit enhanced damage that corresponds with a retarded p38-MAPK-dependent transition of their macrophages towards an anti-inflammatory phenotype. Zeb1-deficient injured muscles also display a delayed and poorer regeneration that is accounted by the retarded anti-inflammatory macrophage transition and their intrinsically deficient muscle satellite cells (MuSCs). Macrophages in Zeb1-deficient injured muscles show lower phosphorylation of p38 and its forced activation reverts the enhanced muscle damage and poorer regeneration. MuSCs require ZEB1 to maintain their quiescence, prevent their premature activation following injury, and drive efficient regeneration in dystrophic muscles. These data indicate that ZEB1 protects muscle from damage and is required for its regeneration.",P11047,XA,['Laminin'],['XA'],[],[],['Laminin'],['XA']

PFE suppressed the adhesion of human endometriotic cells 11Z and 12Z to human mesothelial Met5A cells. In addition, PFE significantly inhibited the migration of 11Z and 12Z cells as shown by woundhealing and transwell migration assays. PFE reduced the protein and mRNA levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 in endometriotic cells. Moreover, extracellular signalregulated kinase (ERK)1/2 was activated by PFE treatment, and an ERK1/2 inhibitor, PD98059, significantly inhibited PFE-inhibited cell migration in endometriotic cells.

The invasiveness of these tumours requires hydrolases which are regulated through AP-1-dependent transcriptional mechanisms. Since the amount/activity of transcription factors bound to the AP-1 motif are regulated partly through the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/ERK2), we determined the effect of PD 098059, an inhibitor of ERK1/ERK2 activation, on the in vivo invasiveness of a human squamous cell carcinoma cell line (UM-SCC-1) derived from the oral cavity. We utilized the floor of mouth musculature consisting of the mylohyoid, geniohyoid and genioglossus muscle (which are sequentially arranged), as a natural barrier to assess tumour spread in vivo in the nude mouse. Mice were inoculated with tumour cells superficial to the mylohyoid muscle. After 18 days, tumours were injected with either empty liposomes (control) or liposomes containing 5 microM PD 098059 and, after an additional 22 days, the jaws of mice examined histologically. Highly infiltrative tumours, which had penetrated the genioglossus muscle, were evident in 10/12 control mice. In contrast, in 9/12 mice in which the tumours were injected with PD 098059, tumours did not extend beyond the mylohyoid or geniohyoid muscles. Tumours penetrated bone nutrient canals in 7/12 control mice but in only 3/12 PD 098059-treated mice. Neurotropism, characteristic of aggressive oral squamous cell carcinoma, was evident in 6/12 control mice but was completely abolished (0/12 mice) in the PD 098059-treated mice. Using a staging system based on the muscle layer involved, neurotropism, as well as bone involvement, we found the inhibition of invasion to be statistically significant (P < 0.01). The reduced invasiveness of the PD 098059-liposome-treated oral cancers was associated with diminished 92-kDa type IV collagenase and ERK1/ERK2 activities but was not a consequence of a slower tumour growth rate. This is the first study to demonstrate reduced in vivo invasiveness of a malignancy brought about by an inhibitor of ERK1/ERK2 activation. These results raise the exciting possibility that second generation PD 098059 congeners may reduce the spread of the disease in patients afflicted with oral cancers.",P14780,XA,"['92 kDa type IV collagenase', 'Gelatinase B', '92 kDa type IV collagenase', 'MMP-9']",['XA'],['92 kDa type IV collagenase'],[],"['Gelatinase B', '92 kDa type IV collagenase', 'MMP-9']",['XA']
PMC1220651,Stress stimuli increase calcium-induced arachidonic acid release through phosphorylation of cytosolic phospholipase A2.,"Stress stimuli such as free radicals, high osmolarity or arsenite activate stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs) in a wide variety of cells. In the present study, we have investigated the ability of several stress stimuli to activate SAPKs in platelets and to induce phosphorylation of their substrates. Treatment of human platelets with H(2)O(2) stimulated SAPK2a and its downstream target mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase-2 (MAPKAP-K2). Kinase activity reached a maximum after 2-5 min and declined towards basal levels after 15 min. Arsenite caused a steady increase of MAPKAP-K2 activity up to 15 min. The level of maximal kinase activation by H(2)O(2) and arsenite was comparable with the effect caused by the physiological platelet stimulus thrombin. A high osmolarity solution of sorbitol induced comparatively small activation of SAPK2a and MAPKAP-K2. The 42-kDa extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 2 was not activated by H(2)O(2), sorbitol or arsenite. None of these stimuli triggered significant arachidonic acid release on their own. However, H(2)O(2) and sorbitol enhanced the release of arachidonic acid induced by the calcium ionophore A23187. This effect was reversed by the inhibitor of SAPK2a, 4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-(4-methylsulphinylphenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl) imidazole (SB 203580), but not by the inhibitor of the ERK2-activating pathway, 2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-oxanaphthalen-4-one (PD 98059). Both H(2)O(2) and sorbitol increased phosphorylation of cytosolic phospholipase A(2) (cPLA(2)) and its intrinsic activity; both responses were blocked by SB 203580. Phosphorylation of cPLA(2) by H(2)O(2) occurred on Ser-505, a reaction that is known to increase the intrinsic lipase activity of the enzyme. Our results demonstrate that activation of SAPKs by stress stimuli primes cPLA(2) activation through phosphorylation. In vivo, this mechanism would lead to the sensitization of platelet activation and may be an important risk factor in thrombotic disease.",P14780,XA,['GELB'],['XA'],[],[],['GELB'],['XA']

As hypoxia in the epidermis is important for maintaining skin homeostasis, we examined the regulation of TSLP expression by hypoxic conditions in normal skin epithelial tissues. TNF-α-induced expression of TSLP in human keratinocyte HaCaT and in mouse keratinocyte PAM212 cell lines were inhibited under hypoxic condition (1% O2), although the mRNA expressions of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, and VEGF-A were not inhibited. Hypoxia-mimicking conditions, which include NiCl2, CoCl2, and DMOG, an inhibitor of 2-oxoglutarate-dependent enzymes, also selectively inhibited TNF-α-induced TSLP expression. These results suggested that inactivation of prolyl hydroxylase by hypoxia and hypoxia-mimicking conditions is involved in the repression of TNF-α-induced TSLP expression. Interestingly, the inhibition of TSLP production by hypoxic treatment was significantly reversed by treatment with the HIF-2α antagonist but not with the HIF-1α inhibitor. DMOG-induced inhibition of TSLP promoter activity was dependent on the -71 to +185 bp promoter region, suggesting that the binding of HIF-2 to hypoxia response element (HRE) in this region repressed the TSLP expression.

PMC8849140,4R-cembranoid protects neuronal cells from oxygen-glucose deprivation by modulating microglial cell activation.,"As major immune responsive cells in the central nervous system (CNS), activated microglia can present pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype aggravating the neuronal injury or anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype providing neuroprotection and promoting neuronal survival in neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we demonstrated that a compound, 4R-cembranoid (4R, 1S, 2E, 4R, 6R,-7E, 11E-2, 7, 11-cembratriene-4, 6-diol cembranoids) promoted M2 phenotype while attenuated M1 phenotype in N9 cells, a microglial cell line. Following Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) or Oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) treatment, the N9 cells treated by 1 µM 4R showed an increased Arginase-1 (Arg1, a M2 marker) expression and a reduced inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS, M1 marker) expression. In addition, the conditioned medium of 4R-treated post-OGD N9 cells protected neuro2a cells, a neuronal cell line, from OGD-induced injury. The viability of neuro2a cells in OGD condition was increased by 54.5% after treated with the conditioned medium of 4R-treated post-OGD N9 cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated the protective mechanism of 4R was associated with a decreased TNF-α release and an increased IL-10 release from N9 cells. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that the neuroprotective effects of 4R were through the regulation of microglial activation by promoting the protective M2 activation and inhibiting the damaging M1 activation. Therefore, the findings of this study suggest that 4R could be a promising lead structure for the development of drugs for the treatment of ischemic stroke and other neurodegenerative diseases with an inflammatory component involved.",P22301,XA,['IL-10'],['XA'],[],[],['IL-10'],['XA']

PMC6757920,Activation of presynaptic P2X7-like receptors depresses mossy fiber-CA3 synaptic transmission through p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase.,"P2X(7) receptor subunits form homomeric ATP-gated, calcium-permeable cation channels. In this study, we used Western blots and immunocytochemistry to demonstrate that P2X(7) receptors are abundant on presynaptic terminals of mossy fiber synapses in the rat hippocampus. P2X(7)-immunoreactive protein was detected using a specific P2X(7) antibody in Western blots of protein isolated from whole hippocampus and from a subcellular fraction containing mossy fiber synaptosomes. P2X(7) immunoreactivity was colocalized with syntaxin 1A/B-immunoreactivity in mossy fiber terminals in the dentate hilus and stratum lucidum of CA3. Extracellular and whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings in CA3 revealed that bath application of the potent P2X(7) agonist 2',3'-O-(4-benzoylbenzoyl)-ATP (Bz-ATP) caused a long-lasting inhibition of neurotransmission at mossy fiber-CA3 synapses. Consistent with a presynaptic action at mossy fiber synapses, Bz-ATP had no significant effect on neurotransmission at associational-commissural synapses in CA3 but increased paired-pulse facilitation during depression of mossy fiber evoked currents. In addition, Bz-ATP had no postsynaptic effect on holding current or conductance of CA3 neurons. Bz-ATP-induced mossy fiber synaptic depression was blocked by the P2X(7) antagonist oxidized ATP but not by the P2X(1-3,5,6) antagonist pyridoxalphosphate-6-azophenyl-2',4'-disulfonic acid or the P2Y antagonist reactive blue 2. Finally, an antagonist of p38 MAP kinase activation [4-(4-fluorophenyl)2-(4-methylsulfinylphenyl)5-(4-pyridyl)imidazole] but not extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 MAP kinase (2'-amino-3'-methoxyflavone) blocked the synaptic depression mediated by Bz-ATP, suggesting that this presynaptic inhibition was mediated by activation of p38 MAP kinase. The results of the present study demonstrate that activation of presynaptic P2X(7) receptors depresses mossy fiber-CA3 synaptic transmission through activation of p38 MAP kinase.",P28482,XA,"['p38', 'ERK', 'ERK2', 'p38']",['XA'],['p38'],[],"['ERK', 'ERK2', 'p38']",['XA']
PMC3943818,Angiotensin II induces Fat1 expression/activation and vascular smooth muscle cell migration via Nox1-dependent reactive oxygen species generation.,"Fat1 is an atypical cadherin that controls vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation and migration. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase 1 (Nox1) is an important source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in VSMCs. Angiotensin II (Ang II) induces the expression and/or activation of both Fat1 and Nox1 proteins. This study tested the hypothesis that Ang II-induced Fat1 activation and VSMC migration are mediated by Nox1-dependent ROS generation and redox signaling. Studies were performed in cultured VSMCs from Sprague–Dawley rats. Cells were treated with Ang II (1 μmol/L) for short (5 to 30 min) or long term stimulations (3 to 12 h) in the absence or presence of the antioxidant apocynin (10 μmol/L), extracellular-signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (Erk1/2) inhibitor PD98059 (1 μmol/L), or Ang II type 1 receptor (AT1R) valsartan (1 μmol/L). siRNA was used to knockdown Nox1 or Fat1. Cell migration was determined by Boyden chamber assay. Ang II increased Fat1 mRNA and protein levels and promoted Fat1 translocation to the cell membrane, responses that were inhibited by AT1R antagonist and antioxidant treatment. Downregulation of Nox1 inhibited the effects of Ang II on Fat1 protein expression. Nox1 protein induction, ROS generation, and p44/p42 MAPK phosphorylation in response to Ang II were prevented by valsartan and apocynin, and Nox1 siRNA inhibited Ang II-induced ROS generation. Knockdown of Fat1 did not affect Ang II-mediated increases in Nox1 expression or ROS. Inhibition of p44/p42 MAPK phosphorylation by PD98059 abrogated the Ang II-induced increase in Fat1 expression and membrane translocation. Knockdown of Fat1 inhibited Ang II-induced VSMC migration, which was also prevented by valsartan, apocynin, PD98059, and Nox1 siRNA. Our findings indicate that Ang II regulates Fat1 expression and activity and induces Fat1-dependent VSMC migration via activation of AT1R, ERK1/2, and Nox1-derived ROS, suggesting a role for Fat1 downstream of Ang II signaling that leads to vascular remodeling.",P28482,XA,"['ERK', 'p38']",['XA'],[],[],"['ERK', 'p38']",['XA']
PMC1218972,Bradykinin stimulates cAMP synthesis via mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent regulation of cytosolic phospholipase A2 and prostaglandin E2 release in airway smooth muscle.,"Bradykinin stimulates cAMP synthesis in cultured airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells. This occurs via a pathway that involves: (1) the protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK); (2) the MAPK-dependent phosphorylation and activation of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) and (3) the utilization of cPLA2-derived arachidonate by the cyclo-oxygenase pathway to produce prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). PGE2 is released and binds to cell surface receptors to stimulate intracellular cAMP synthesis. The signalling pathway was confirmed by the use of PD098059 [the inhibitor of MAPK kinase-1 (MEK-1) activation], AACOCF3 (an inhibitor of cPLA2) and indomethacin (an inhibitor of cyclo-oxygenase), which all reduced bradykinin-stimulated cAMP synthesis. Bradykinin also elicits the inhibition of approx. 60% of the total cAMP phosphodiesterase activity in the cell [Stevens, Pyne, Grady and Pyne (1994) Biochem. J. 297, 233-239]. This is likely to decrease the rate of cAMP degradation markedly and therefore to potentiate PGE2-stimulated cAMP synthesis. Acute treatment of ASM cells with PMA (a direct activator of PKC) also stimulated the MAPK-dependent phosphorylation of cPLA2. However, in contrast with bradykinin, PMA did not stimulate arachidonate release, suggesting that additional signals (e.g. Ca2+ ions) are required for phosphorylation by MAPK to activate cPLA2. PMA was also without effect on PGE2 release and cAMP synthesis. Evidence that PKC can also directly regulate adenylate cyclase was obtained by using cells pretreated with cholera toxin. Under these conditions, PMA stimulated cAMP synthesis independently of arachidonate metabolites. Furthermore the combined treatment of cells with PMA (to activate PKC) and PGE2 (to activate Gs) stimulated synergistic cAMP synthesis. This might be due to the presence of the type 2 adenylate cyclase, which is synergistically activated by Gs and PKC.",P28482,XA,"['Mitogen-activated protein kinase 1', 'ERK', 'ERK-2']",['XA'],['Mitogen-activated protein kinase 1'],[],"['ERK', 'ERK-2']",['XA']
PMC1217921,Phosphorylation and activation of p42 and p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase are required for the P2 purinoceptor stimulation of endothelial prostacyclin production.,"Extracellular ATP and ADP, released from platelets and other sites stimulate the endothelial production of prostacyclin (PGI2) by acting on G-protein-coupled P2Y2 and P2Y2 purinoceptors, contributing to the maintenance of a non-thrombogenic surface. The mechanism, widely described as being dependent on elevated cytosolic [Ca2+], also requires protein tyrosine phosphorylation. Here we show that activation of both these P2 receptor types leads to the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of both the p42 and p44 forms of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). 2-Methylthio-ATP and UTP, selectively activating P2Y1 and P2Y2 purinoceptors respectively, and ATP, a non-selective agonist at these two receptors, stimulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of both p42mapk and p44mapk, as revealed by Western blots with an antiserum specific for the tyrosine-phosphorylated forms of the enzymes. By using separation on Resource Q columns, peptide kinase activity associated with the phosphorylated MAPK enzymes distributes into two peaks, one mainly p42mapk and one mainly p44mapk, both of which are stimulated by ATP with respect to kinase activity and phospho-MAPK immunoreactivity. Stimulation of P2Y1 or P2Y2 purinoceptors leads to a severalfold increase in PGI2 efflux; this was blocked in a dose-dependent manner by the selective MAPK kinase inhibitor PD98059. This drug also blocked the agonist-stimulated increase in phospho-MAPK immunoreactivity for both p42mapk and p44mapk but left the phospholipase C response to P2 agonists essentially unchanged. Olomoucine has been reported to inhibit p44mapk activity. Here we show that in the same concentration range olomoucine inhibits activity in both peaks from the Resource Q column and also the agonist stimulation of 6-keto-PGF1, but has no effect on agonist-stimulated phospho-MAPK immunoreactivity. These results provide direct evidence for the involvement of p42 and p44 MAPK in the PGI2 response of intact endothelial cells: we have shown that both the endothelial P2Y purinoceptors are linked to activation of MAPK, and that activation of this pathway is a requirement for the stimulation by ATP/ADP of endothelial PGI2 production.",P28482,XA,"['Mitogen-activated protein kinase 1', 'ERK', 'P42MAPK']",['XA'],['Mitogen-activated protein kinase 1'],[],"['ERK', 'P42MAPK']",['XA']

PMC5016702,Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH)-dependent Regulation of Extracellular Regulated Kinase (ERK) Phosphorylation by the Mitogen-activated Protein (MAP) Kinase Phosphatase MKP3.,"Within the ovarian follicle, granulosa cells (GCs) surround and support immature oocytes. FSH promotes the differentiation and proliferation of GCs and is essential for fertility. We recently reported that ERK activation is necessary for FSH to induce key genes that define the preovulatory GC. This research focused on the phosphoregulation by FSH of ERK within GCs. FSH-stimulated ERK phosphorylation on Thr(202)/Tyr(204) was PKA-dependent, but MEK(Ser(217)/Ser(221)) phosphorylation was not regulated; rather, MEK was already active. However, treatment of GCs with the EGF receptor inhibitor AG1478, a dominant-negative RAS, an Src homology 2 domain-containing Tyr phosphatase inhibitor (NSC 87877), or the MEK inhibitor PD98059 blocked FSH-dependent ERK(Thr(202)/Tyr(204)) phosphorylation, demonstrating the requirement for upstream pathway components. We hypothesized that FSH via PKA enhances ERK phosphorylation by inhibiting the activity of a protein phosphatase that constitutively dephosphorylates ERK in the absence of FSH, allowing MEK-phosphorylated ERK to accumulate in the presence of FSH because of inactivation of the phosphatase. GCs treated with different phosphatase inhibitors permitted elimination of both Ser/Thr and Tyr phosphatases and implicated dual specificity phosphatases (DUSPs) in the dephosphorylation of ERK. Treatment with MAP kinase phosphatase (MKP3, DUSP6) inhibitors increased ERK(Thr(202)/Tyr(204)) phosphorylation in the absence of FSH to levels comparable with ERK phosphorylated in the presence of FSH. ERK co-immunoprecipitated with Myc-FLAG-tagged MKP3(DUSP6). GCs treated with MKP3(DUSP6) inhibitors blocked and PKA inhibitors enhanced dephosphorylation of recombinant ERK2-GST in an in vitro phosphatase assay. Together, these results suggest that FSH-stimulated ERK activation in GCs requires the PKA-dependent inactivation of MKP3(DUSP6).",P28482,XA,"['ERK', 'ERK2', 'Extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2', 'p38']",['XA'],[],[],"['ERK', 'ERK2', 'Extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2', 'p38']",['XA']

This prompted us to investigate whether Inh-2-induced M-phase arrest was dependent on activation of the p42MAPK pathway. We demonstrate here that MAPK activity is required for Inh-2-induced M-phase arrest, as inhibition of MAPK by PD98059 allowed cycling extracts to exit M phase, despite the presence of Inh-2. We next investigated whether Inh-2 phosphorylation by the MAPK pathway was required to induce an M-phase arrest. We discovered that while p90Rsk (a MAPK protein required for M-phase arrest) is able to phosphorylate Inh-2, this phosphorylation is not required for Inh-2 function. Overall, our results suggest a novel mechanism linking p42MAPK and PP1 pathways during M phase of the cell cycle.",P28482,XA,['P42MAPK'],['XA'],[],[],['P42MAPK'],['XA']
PMC2755982,A(1) adenosine receptor-mediated PKC and p42/p44 MAPK signaling in mouse coronary artery smooth muscle cells.,"The A(1) adenosine receptor (A(1)AR) is coupled to G(i)/G(o) proteins, but the downstream signaling pathways in smooth muscle cells are unclear. This study was performed in coronary artery smooth muscle cells (CASMCs) isolated from the mouse heart [A(1)AR wild type (A(1)WT) and A(1)AR knockout (A(1)KO)] to delineate A(1)AR signaling through the PKC pathway. In A(1)WT cells, treatment with (2S)-N(6)-(2-endo-norbornyl)adenosine (ENBA; 10(-5)M) increased A(1)AR expression by 150%, which was inhibited significantly by the A(1)AR antagonist 1,3-dipropyl-8-cyclopentylxanthine (10(-6)M), but not in A(1)KO CASMCs. PKC isoforms were identified by Western blot analysis in the cytosolic and membrane fractions of cell homogenates of CASMCs. In A(1)WT and A(1)KO cells, significant levels of basal PKC-alpha were detected in the cytosolic fraction. Treatment with the A(1)AR agonist ENBA (10(-5)M) translocated PKC-alpha from the cytosolic to membrane fraction significantly in A(1)WT but not A(1)KO cells. Phospholipase C isoforms (betaI, betaIII, and gamma(1)) were analyzed using specific antibodies where ENBA treatment led to the increased expression of PLC-betaIII in A(1)WT CASMCs while having no effect in A(1)KO CASMCs. In A(1)WT cells, ENBA increased PKC-alpha expression and p42/p44 MAPK (ERK1/2) phospohorylation by 135% and 145%, respectively. These effects of ENBA were blocked by Gö-6976 (PKC-alpha inhibitor) and PD-98059 (p42/p44 MAPK inhibitor). We conclude that A(1)AR stimulation by ENBA activates the PKC-alpha signaling pathway, leading to p42/p44 MAPK phosphorylation in CASMCs.",P28482,XA,"['ERK', 'p38']",['XA'],[],[],"['ERK', 'p38']",['XA']
PMC1572256,Lipopolysaccharide enhances bradykinin-induced signal transduction via activation of Ras/Raf/MEK/MAPK in canine tracheal smooth muscle cells.,"Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was found to induce inflammatory responses and to enhance bronchial hyperreactivity to several contractile agonists. However, the implication of LPS in the pathogenesis of bronchial hyperreactivity was not completely understood. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the effect of LPS on mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation associated with potentiation of bradykinin (BK)-induced inositol phosphates (IPs) accumulation and Ca(2+) mobilization in canine cultured tracheal smooth muscle cells (TSMCs). LPS stimulated phosphorylation of p42/p44 MAPK in a time- and concentration-dependent manner using a Western blot analysis against a specific phosphorylated form of MAPK antibody. Maximal stimulation of the p42 and p44 MAPK isoforms occurred after 7 min-incubation and the maximal effect was achieved with 100 microg ml(-1) LPS. Pretreatment of TSMCs with LPS potentiated BK-induced IPs accumulation and Ca(2+) mobilization. However, there was no effect on the IPs response induced by endothelin-1, 5-hydroxytryptamine, and carbachol. In addition, pretreatment with PDGF-BB enhanced BK-induced IPs response. These enhancements by LPS and PDGF-BB might be due to an increase in BK B(2) receptor density (B(max)) in TSMCs, characterized by competitive inhibition of [(3)H]-BK binding using B(1) and B(2) receptor-selective reagents. The enhancing effects of LPS and PDGF-BB were attenuated by PD98059, an inhibitor of MAPK kinase (MEK), suggesting that the effect of LPS may share a common signalling pathway with PDGF-BB in TSMCs. Furthermore, overexpression of dominant negative mutants, H-Ras-15A and Raf-N4, significantly suppressed p42/p44 MAPK activation induced by LPS and PDGF-BB, indicating that Ras and Raf may be required for activation of these kinases. These results suggest that the augmentation of BK-induced responses produced by LPS might be, at least in part, mediated through activation of Ras/Raf/MEK/MAPK pathway in TSMCs.",P28482,XA,"['ERK', 'ERK2', 'p38']",['XA'],[],[],"['ERK', 'ERK2', 'p38']",['XA']

The TS active site is relatively conserved between Cryptosporidium and human enzymes. In previous work, we identified compound 1, (2-amino-4-oxo-4,7-dihydro-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-methyl-phenyl-l-glutamic acid), as a promising selective Cryptosporidium hominis TS (ChTS) inhibitor. In the present study, we explore the structure-activity relationship around 1 glutamate moiety by synthesizing and biochemically evaluating the inhibitory activity of analogues against ChTS and human TS (hTS). X-Ray crystal structures were obtained for compounds bound to both ChTS and hTS. We establish the importance of the 2-phenylacetic acid moiety methylene linker in optimally positioning compounds 23, 24, and 25 within the active site.

PMC5414773,Role of sphingosine kinase/S1P axis in ECM remodeling of cardiac cells elicited by relaxin.,"The initiation and progression of heart failure is linked to adverse cardiac remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM) during disease mainly through the deregulation of myocardial metalloproteinases (MMPs). Relaxin (RLX), a peptide hormone acting as a physiological cardiac effector, is a key regulator of ECM remodeling in reproductive and nonreproductive tissues. Studying primary cultures of mouse cardiac muscle cells and rat H9c2 cardiomyoblasts, we have obtained evidence for a new signaling pathway activated by RLX to induce ECM remodeling that involves the bioactive sphingolipids sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and ceramide. In both cell populations, recombinant human RLX increased sphingosine kinase activity and S1P formation, whereas sphingomyelin and ceramide content were decreased in [(3)H]serine-labeled cells. According to the literature, RLX promoted MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression/release. Pharmacological inhibition of sphingolipid metabolism and silencing of sphingosine kinase 1, the enzyme responsible for S1P formation, were able to prevent MMP expression/release elicited by the hormone and induce the expression of tissue inhibitor of MMPs. In addition, we found that sphingolipid signaling is required for the regulation of connective tissue growth factor, a member of the CCN 1-3 family of genes that are involved in cell proliferation and differentiation. Finally, the induction of cardiomyoblast maturation induced by RLX was also found to be counteracted by inhibition of S1P formation. In conclusion, these findings provide a novel mechanism by which RLX acts on cardiac ECM remodeling and cardiac cell differentiation and offer interesting therapeutic options to prevent heart fibrosis and to favor myocardial regeneration.",P29279,XA,['Connective tissue growth factor'],['XA'],[],[],['Connective tissue growth factor'],['XA']

Optimization of drug synergy chemotherapy is fundamental in acute lymphocytic leukemia and other cancers. This study aimed to analyze the pharmacodynamic synergy between the anti-metabolite cytarabine and WEE1 inhibitor adavosertib on acute leukemia cell lines CCRF-CEM and Jurkat. In both cell lines analysis of concentration-inhibition curves of adavosertib-cytarabine combinations and synergy matrixes supported mutually synergistic drug interactions. Overall mean ( ± SD) synergy scores were higher in Jurkat than CCRF-CEM: Jurkat, ZIP 22.51 ± 1.1, Bliss 22.49 ± 1.1, HSA 23.44 ± 1.0, Loewe 14.16 ± 1.2; and, CCRF-CEM, ZIP 9.17 ± 1.9, Bliss 8.13 ± 2.1, HSA 11.48 ± 1.9 and Loewe 4.99 ± 1.8. Jurkat also surpassed CCRF-CEM in high-degree synergistic adavosertib-cytarabine interactions with mean across-models synergy values of ∼89.1% ± 2.9 for 63 nM cytarabine-97 nM adavosertib (91.4% inhibition synergy barometer). Combination sensitivity scores scatter plots confirmed combination's synergy efficacy. This combined approach permitted identification and prioritization of 63 nM cytarabine-97 nM adavosertib for multiple endpoints analysis. This combination did not affect PBMC viability, while exhibiting Jurkat selective synergy. Immunoblots also revealed Jurkat selective synergistically increased γH2AX phosphorylation, while CDC2 phosphorylation effects were attributed to adavosertib's WEE1 inhibition. In conclusion, the high synergistic efficacy combination of cytarabine (63 nM) and adavosertib (97 nM) was associated with remarkable alterations in metabolites related to the Krebs cycle in Jurkat. The metabolic pathways and processes are related to gluconeogenesis, amino acids, nucleotides, glutathione, electron transport and Warburg effect.

Currently, there is no specific approach for the treatment of MDS. Here, we report that bortezomib (BTZ), a proteasome inhibitor that has been used to treat plasma cell myeloma, induced G2/M phase cycle arrest in the MDS cell line SKM-1 through upregulation of Wee1, a negative regulator of G2/M phase transition. Treatment by BTZ led to reduced SKM-1 cell viability as well as increased apoptosis and autophagy. The BTZ-induced cell death was associated with reduced expression of p-ERK. To elucidate the implications of downregulation of p-ERK, we established the BTZ resistant cell line SKM-1R. Our data show that resistance to BTZ-induced apoptosis could be reversed by the MEK inhibitors U0126 or PD98059.

PMC2716006,Growth factor-dependent trafficking of cerebellar NMDA receptors via protein kinase B/Akt phosphorylation of NR2C.,"NMDA receptor subunit composition varies throughout the brain, providing molecular diversity in NMDA receptor function. The NR2 subunits (NR2A-D) in large part dictate the distinct functional properties of NMDA receptors and differentially regulate receptor trafficking. Although the NR2C subunit is highly enriched in cerebellar granule cells and plays a unique role in cerebellar function, little is known about NR2C-specific regulation of NMDA receptors. Here, we demonstrate that PKB/Akt directly phosphorylates NR2C on serine 1096 (S1096). In addition, we identify 14-3-3epsilon as an NR2C interactor, whose binding is dependent on S1096 phosphorylation. Both growth factor stimulation and NMDA receptor activity lead to a robust increase in both phosphorylation of NR2C on S1096 and surface expression of cerebellar NMDA receptors. Finally, we find that NR2C expression, unlike NR2A and NR2B, supports neuronal survival. Thus, our data provide a direct mechanistic link between growth factor stimulation and regulation of cerebellar NMDA receptors.",P31749,XA,"['Protein kinase B', 'PKB', 'Protein kinase B']",['XA'],['Protein kinase B'],[],"['PKB', 'Protein kinase B']",['XA']

We aimed to investigate the influence of Octreotide on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated human pulmonary epithelial cell damage. After stimulated by LPS, BEAS-2B cells were treated with various concentrations of Octreotide. CCK-8 assay and LDH kits were to evaluate cell cytotoxicity. ELISA kits were to analyze the levels of inflammatory factors. TUNEL staining was to measure cell apoptosis. Western blot assay was used to assess the expression of apoptosis-related proteins, autophagy-related proteins and AKT/mTOR signaling-related proteins. Then, 3-methyladenine (3-MA) was adopted for treating BEAS-2B cells to determine its effects on inflammation and apoptosis. Afterward, adding AKT agonist (SC79) or mTOR antagonist (rapamycin) to explore the impact of Octreotide on autophagy. Results revealed that Octreotide notably enhanced cell viability and reduced LDH activity. The levels of inflammatory factors were significantly decreased following Octreotide treatment. Additionally, Octreotide attenuated the apoptotic capacity of LPS-induced BEAS-2B cells, led to the up-regulation of Bcl-2 protein level while cut down the protein levels of Bax and cleaved caspase3. Remarkably, the expression of autophagy-related protein LC3II/I and Beclin1 was elevated after Octreotide administration. Importantly, the suppressive effects of Octreotide on the inflammation and apoptosis of LPS-induced BEAS-2B cells was abrogated by 3-MA. Further experiments suggested that Octreotide downregulated p-AKT and mTOR expression in LPS-stimulated BEAS-2B cells. SC79 addition inhibited autophagy, evidenced by downregulated LC3II/I and Beclin1 expression while rapamycin presented the opposite effects. To conclude, Octreotide activates autophagy to alleviate LPS-induced pulmonary epithelial cell injury by inhibiting the AKT/mTOR signaling.",P31749,XA,['Protein kinase B'],['XA'],[],[],['Protein kinase B'],['XA']

These colonic MSCs expressed high Ptgs2 levels not through interaction with bacterial products but instead as a consequence of mRNA stabilization downstream of Fgf9 (fibroblast growth factor 9), a growth factor that is constitutively expressed by the intestinal epithelium. This stabilization was mediated partially through a mechanism involving endogenous CUG-binding protein 2 (CUGbp2).

PMC9534909,BMS794833 inhibits macrophage efferocytosis by directly binding to MERTK and inhibiting its activity.,"Myeloid epithelial reproductive proto-oncogene tyrosine kinase (MERTK) plays an essential role in modulating cancer immune tolerance by regulating macrophage efferocytosis. Studies are underway to develop small-molecule chemicals that inhibit MERTK as cancer immunotherapeutic agents, but these efforts are in their early stages. This study identified BMS794833, whose primary targets are MET and VEGFR2, as a potent MERTK inhibitor and developed a real-time efferocytosis monitoring system. The X-ray cocrystal structure revealed that BMS794833 was in contact with the ATP-binding pocket and the allosteric back pocket, rendering MERTK inactive. Homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence kinetic and Western blotting analyses showed that BMS794833 competitively inhibited MERTK activity in vitro and inhibited the autophosphorylation of MERTK in macrophages. We developed a system to monitor MERTK-dependent efferocytosis in real time, and using this system, we confirmed that BMS794833 significantly inhibited the efferocytosis of differentiated macrophages. Finally, BMS794833 significantly inhibited efferocytosis in vivo in a mouse model. These data show that BMS794833 is a type II MERTK inhibitor that regulates macrophage efferocytosis. In addition, the real-time efferocytosis monitoring technology developed in this study has great potential for future applications.",P35968,XA,"['VEGFR', 'VEGFR', 'VEGFR-2', 'VEGFR2']",['XA'],['VEGFR'],[],"['VEGFR', 'VEGFR-2', 'VEGFR2']",['XA']
PMC6349158,"Phorbol esters induce PLVAP expression via VEGF and additional secreted molecules in MEK1-dependent and p38, JNK and PI3K/Akt-independent manner.","Endothelial diaphragms are subcellular structures critical for mammalian survival with poorly understood biogenesis. Plasmalemma vesicle associated protein (PLVAP) is the only known diaphragm component and is necessary for diaphragm formation. Very little is known about PLVAP regulation. Phorbol esters (PMA) are known to induce de novo PLVAP expression and diaphragm formation. We show that this induction relies on the de novo production of soluble factors that will act in an autocrine manner to induce PLVAP transcription and protein expression. We identified vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) signalling through VEGFR2 as a necessary but not sufficient downstream event as VEGF-A inhibition with antibodies and siRNA or pharmacological inhibition of VEGFR2 only partially inhibit PLVAP upregulation. In terms of downstream pathways, inhibition of MEK1/Erk1/2 MAP kinase blocked PLVAP upregulation, whereas inhibition of p38 and JNK MAP kinases or PI3K and Akt had no effect on PMA-induced PLVAP expression. In conclusion, we show that VEGF-A along with other secreted proteins act synergistically to up-regulate PLVAP in MEK1/Erk1/2 dependent manner, bringing us one step further into understanding the genesis of the essential structures that are endothelial diaphragms.",P35968,XA,"['VEGFR', 'VEGFR2']",['XA'],[],[],"['VEGFR', 'VEGFR2']",['XA']

PMC6725132,Stimulation of microglial metabotropic glutamate receptor mGlu2 triggers tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced neurotoxicity in concert with microglial-derived Fas ligand.,"Activated microglia may be detrimental to neuronal survival in a number of neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, strategies that reduce microglial neurotoxicity may have therapeutic benefit. Stimulation of group II metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors on rat primary microglia with the specific group II agonist 2S,2'R,3'R-2-(2',3'-dicarboxy-cyclopropyl)glycine for 24 h induced microglial activation and resulted in a neurotoxic microglial phenotype. These effects were attributable to preferential mGlu2 stimulation, because N-acetyl-L-aspartyl-L-glutamate, a specific mGlu3 agonist, did not induce microglial activation or neurotoxicity. Stimulation of microglial mGlu2 but not mGlu3 induced caspase-3 activation in cerebellar granule neurons in culture, using microglial-conditioned media as well as cocultures. Stimulation of microglial mGlu2 induced tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) release, which contributed to microglial neurotoxicity mediated via neuronal TNF receptor 1 and caspase-3 activation. Stimulation of microglial group I or III mGlu receptors did not induce TNFalpha release. TNFalpha was only neurotoxic in the presence of microglia or microglial-conditioned medium. The toxicity of TNFalpha could be prevented by coexposure of neurons to conditioned medium from microglia stimulated by the specific group III agonist L-2-amino-4-phosphono-butyric acid. The neurotoxicity of TNFalpha derived from mGlu2-stimulated microglia was potentiated by microglial-derived Fas ligand (FasL), the death receptor ligand. FasL was constitutively expressed in microglia and shed after mGlu2 stimulation. Our data suggest that selective and inverse modulation of microglial mGlu2 and mGlu3 may prove a therapeutic target in neuroinflammatory diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis.",P42574,XA,['Caspase-3'],['XA'],[],[],['Caspase-3'],['XA']

PMC28047,Farnesyltransferase inhibitors induce cytochrome c release and caspase 3 activation preferentially in transformed cells.,"Farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs) represent a new class of anticancer drugs that show promise in blocking the growth of tumors. Here, we report that FTIs are capable of inducing apoptosis of transformed but not untransformed cells. Treatment of v-K-ras-transformed normal rat kidney (KNRK) cells with FTIs leads to the induction of apoptotic cell morphology, chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation. In addition, fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis of FTI-treated KNRK cells shows a sub-G1 apoptotic peak (chromosome content of <2 N). This FTI-induced apoptosis is evident only when the cells are grown in low serum conditions (0.1% fetal calf serum) and is observed selectively with transformed KNRK cells and not with untransformed NRK cells. Further analysis of the mechanism underlying this apoptosis has shown that FTI treatment of KNRK cells results in the activation of caspase 3 but not caspase 1. Moreover, the addition of Z-DEVD-fmk, an agent that interferes with caspase 3 activity, can inhibit FTI-induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Introduction of the CASP-3 gene into MCF7 cells, which lack caspase 3 activity, results in a significant increase of FTI-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, FTI induces the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol. This release is an important feature of caspase 3-mediated apoptosis. These results suggest that FTIs induce apoptosis through the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria resulting in caspase 3 activation.",P42574,XA,"['caspase 3', 'Caspase-3', 'caspase 3', 'CASP-3']",['XA'],['caspase 3'],[],"['Caspase-3', 'caspase 3', 'CASP-3']",['XA']

PMC5443909,miR-1290 Is a Biomarker in DNA-Mismatch-Repair-Deficient Colon Cancer and Promotes Resistance to 5-Fluorouracil by Directly Targeting hMSH2.,"5-Fluorouracil (5FU)-based adjuvant therapy is the first-line therapy for treating stage II and III colon cancer after surgery. However, its therapeutic efficacy is limited because of chemoresistance, especially in deficient mismatch repair (dMMR) colon cancer. Here, we first used laser capture microdissection to obtain purified cells from four dMMR and four proficient mismatch repair (pMMR) colon cancer tissues. Second, microRNA (miRNA) microarray chips were used to identify miRNAs that are differentially expressed between these two classes of tumors. Third, we analyzed their differential expression by qRT-PCR in a panel of 5-FU-resistant colon cancer cell lines. We identified that miR-1290 was one of the most upregulated miRNAs in both dMMR colon cancer tissues and 5-FU-resistant cells. We also found that miR-1290 was positively correlated with dMMR status and predicted poor prognosis in stage II and III colon cancer patients who received 5-FU-based chemotherapy. Furthermore, we demonstrated that inhibition of the expression of miR-1290 enhanced sensitivity to 5-FU treatment in vitro and in tumor xenografts in vivo by direct targeting hMSH2. Our study indicates that miR-1290 may become a promising biomarker of dMMR colon cancer and predicts the prognosis of stage II and III patients who receive 5-FU-based adjuvant therapy.",P43246,PCA,"['hMSH2', 'hMSH2']",['PCA'],['hMSH2'],[],['hMSH2'],['PCA']

As the active ingredient of the n-butanol extract of Amygdalus mongolica (BUT), amygdalin inhibits PF. However, its mechanisms of action are unclear and need further verification. Therefore, the purpose of the present studies was to investigate the anti-fibrotic effects of BUT on PF by serum metabolomics and the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) pathway. Sixty male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into control, untreated PF, prednisone-treated (5 mg/kg), and BUT-treated (1.75, 1.25, 0.75 g/kg) groups, and the respective drugs were administered intragastrically for 21 days. The serum metabolomics profiles were determined by ultra-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF/MS) and metabolism network analysis. The expression of TGF-β1, Smad-3, Smad-7, and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) was measured using a real-time polymerase chain reaction in the lung tissue. BUT significantly alleviated fibrosis by reducing the mRNA expressions of TGF-β1 (from 1.73 to 1.13), Smad-3 (from 2.01 to 1.19), and α-SMA (from 2.14 to 1.19) and increasing that of Smad7 (from 0.17 to 0.62).

PMC3191102,Suppression of eNOS-derived superoxide by caveolin-1: a biopterin-dependent mechanism.,"In the vasculature, nitric oxide (NO) is generated by endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) in a calcium/calmodulin-dependent reaction. In the absence of the requisite eNOS cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (BH(4)), NADPH oxidation is uncoupled from NO generation, leading to the production of superoxide. Although this phenomenon is apparent with purified enzyme, cellular studies suggest that formation of the BH(4) oxidation product, dihydrobiopterin, is the molecular trigger for eNOS uncoupling rather than BH(4) depletion alone. In the current study, we investigated the effects of both BH(4) depletion and oxidation on eNOS-derived superoxide production in endothelial cells in an attempt to elucidate the molecular mechanisms regulating eNOS oxidase activity. Results demonstrated that pharmacological depletion of endothelial BH(4) does not result in eNOS oxidase activity, whereas BH(4) oxidation gave rise to significant eNOS-oxidase activity. These findings suggest that the endothelium possesses regulatory mechanisms, which prevent eNOS oxidase activity from pterin-free eNOS. Using a combination of gene silencing and pharmacological approaches, we demonstrate that eNOS-caveolin-1 association is increased under conditions of reduced pterin bioavailability and that this sequestration serves to suppress eNOS uncoupling. Using small interfering RNA approaches, we demonstrate that caveolin-1 gene silencing increases eNOS oxidase activity to 85% of that observed under conditions of BH(4) oxidation. Moreover, when caveolin-1 silencing was combined with a pharmacological inhibitor of AKT, BH(4) depletion increased eNOS-derived superoxide to 165% of that observed with BH(4) oxidation. This study identifies a critical role of caveolin-1 in the regulation of eNOS uncoupling and provides new insight into the mechanisms through which disease-associated changes in caveolin-1 expression may contribute to endothelial dysfunction.",Q03135,Pterin,['Caveolin-1'],"['Pterin', 'Pterin', 'Pterin']",[],[],['Caveolin-1'],"['Pterin', 'Pterin', 'Pterin']"

PMC2430079,Molecular requirements for induction of CTGF expression by TGF-beta1 in primary osteoblasts.,"Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF/CCN2) is a cysteine rich, extracellular matrix protein that acts as an anabolic growth factor to regulate osteoblast differentiation and function. In osteoblasts, CTGF is induced by TGF-beta1 where it acts as a downstream mediator of TGF-beta1 induced matrix production. The molecular mechanisms that control CTGF induction by TGF-beta1 in osteoblasts are not known. To assess the role of individual Smads in mediating the induction of CTGF by TGF-beta1, we used specific Smad siRNAs to block Smad expression. These studies demonstrated that Smads 3 and 4, but not Smad 2, are required for TGF-beta1 induced CTGF promoter activity and expression in osteoblasts. Since the activation of MAPKs (Erk, Jnk and p38) by TGF-beta1 is cell type specific, we were interested in determining the role of individual MAPKs in TGF-beta1 induction of CTGF promoter activity and expression. Using dominant negative (DN) mutants for Erk, Jnk and p38, we demonstrated that the expression of DN-Erk caused a significant inhibition of TGF-beta1 induced CTGF promoter activity. In contrast, the expression of DN-p38 or DN-Jnk failed to inhibit activation of CTGF promoter activity. To confirm the vital role of Erk, we used the Erk inhibitor (PD98059) to block its activation, demonstrating that it prevented TGF-beta1 activation of the CTGF promoter and up-regulation of CTGF expression in osteoblasts. Since Src can also act as a downstream signaling effector for TGF-beta in some cell types, we determined its role in TGF-beta1 induction of CTGF in osteoblasts. Treatment of osteoblasts with a Src family kinase inhibitor, PP2, or the expression of two independent kinase-dead Src mutant constructs caused significant inhibition of TGF-beta1 induced CTGF promoter activity and expression. Additionally, blocking Src activation prevented Erk activation by TGF-beta1 demonstrating a role for Src as an upstream mediator of Erk in regulating CTGF expression in osteoblasts. To investigate the involvement of the TGF-beta1 response element (TRE) and the SMAD binding element (SBE) in CTGF induction, we cloned the rat CTGF proximal promoter (-787 to +1) containing the TRE and SBE motifs into a pGL3-Luciferase reporter construct. Using a combination of CTGF promoter deletion constructs and site-directed mutants, we demonstrated the unique requirement of both the TRE and SBE for CTGF induction by TGF-beta1 in osteoblasts. Electro-mobility shift assays using specific probes containing the TRE, SBE or both showed TGF-beta1 inducible complexes that can be ablated by mutation of the respective motif, confirming their requirement for TGF-beta1 induced CTGF promoter activity. In conclusion, these studies demonstrate that CTGF induction by TGF-beta1 in osteoblasts involves Smads 3 and 4, the Erk and Src signaling pathways, and requires both the TRE and SBE motifs in the CTGF proximal promoter.",Q15796,XA,"['SMAD 2', 'SMAD2', 'Smad2']",['XA'],[],[],"['SMAD 2', 'SMAD2', 'Smad2']",['XA']
PMC11144210,Regulation of cardiac ferroptosis in diabetic human heart failure: uncovering molecular pathways and key targets.,"Diabetes significantly increases the risk of heart failure by inducing myocardial cell death, potentially through ferroptosis-an iron-dependent, non-apoptotic cell death pathway characterized by lipid peroxidation. The role of cardiac ferroptosis in human heart failure, however, remains poorly understood. In this study, we compared cardiac ferroptosis in humans with diabetic heart failure to that in healthy controls. Our findings reveal that diabetes not only intensifies myocardial cell death but also upregulates markers of ferroptosis in human hearts. This is linked to decreased transcription and activity of glutathione peroxidase-4 (GPX4), influenced by reduced levels of activating transcription factor-4 (ATF4) and nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor-2 (NRF2), and downregulation of glutathione reductase (GSR). Additionally, diabetic hearts showed an increased labile iron pool due to enhanced heme metabolism by heme oxygenase-1 (HMOX1), elevated iron import via divalent metal transporter-1 (DMT1), reduced iron storage through ferritin light chain (FLC), and decreased iron export via ferroportin-1 (FPN1). The reduction in FPN1 levels likely results from decreased stabilization by amyloid precursor protein (APP) and diminished NRF2-mediated transcription. Furthermore, diabetes upregulates lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase-3 (LPCAT3), facilitating the integration of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) into phospholipid membranes, and downregulates acyl-CoA thioesterase-1 (ACOT1), which further promotes ferroptosis. LC-MS/MS analysis identified several novel proteins implicated in diabetes-induced cardiac ferroptosis, including upregulated ceruloplasmin, which enhances iron metabolism, and cytochrome b-245 heavy chain (CYBB), a key component of NADPH oxidase that aids in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), along with downregulated voltage-dependent anion-selective channel protein-2 (VDAC2), essential for maintaining mitochondrial membrane potential.

PMC11144210,Regulation of cardiac ferroptosis in diabetic human heart failure: uncovering molecular pathways and key targets.,"Diabetes significantly increases the risk of heart failure by inducing myocardial cell death, potentially through ferroptosis-an iron-dependent, non-apoptotic cell death pathway characterized by lipid peroxidation. The role of cardiac ferroptosis in human heart failure, however, remains poorly understood. In this study, we compared cardiac ferroptosis in humans with diabetic heart failure to that in healthy controls. Our findings reveal that diabetes not only intensifies myocardial cell death but also upregulates markers of ferroptosis in human hearts. This is linked to decreased transcription and activity of glutathione peroxidase-4 (GPX4), influenced by reduced levels of activating transcription factor-4 (ATF4) and nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor-2 (NRF2), and downregulation of glutathione reductase (GSR). Additionally, diabetic hearts showed an increased labile iron pool due to enhanced heme metabolism by heme oxygenase-1 (HMOX1), elevated iron import via divalent metal transporter-1 (DMT1), reduced iron storage through ferritin light chain (FLC), and decreased iron export via ferroportin-1 (FPN1). The reduction in FPN1 levels likely results from decreased stabilization by amyloid precursor protein (APP) and diminished NRF2-mediated transcription. Furthermore, diabetes upregulates lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase-3 (LPCAT3), facilitating the integration of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) into phospholipid membranes, and downregulates acyl-CoA thioesterase-1 (ACOT1), which further promotes ferroptosis. LC-MS/MS analysis identified several novel proteins implicated in diabetes-induced cardiac ferroptosis, including upregulated ceruloplasmin, which enhances iron metabolism, and cytochrome b-245 heavy chain (CYBB), a key component of NADPH oxidase that aids in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), along with downregulated voltage-dependent anion-selective channel protein-2 (VDAC2), essential for maintaining mitochondrial membrane potential.

PMC1682436,Mutation in the 4a-carbinolamine dehydratase gene leads to mild hyperphenylalaninemia with defective cofactor metabolism.,"Hyperphenylalaninemias represent a major class of inherited metabolic disorders. They are most often caused by mutations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene and, less frequently but with usually more serious consequences, in genes necessary for the synthesis and regeneration of the cofactor, tetrahydrobiopterin. This cofactor is absolutely required for all aromatic amino acid hydroxylations, and, recently, nitric oxide production from L-arginine has also been found to be dependent on tetrahydrobiopterin. Phenylalanine hydroxylase catalyzes a coupled reaction in which phenylalanine is converted to tyrosine and in which tetrahydrobiopterin is converted to the unstable carbinolamine, 4a-hydroxytetrahydrobiopterin. The enzyme, carbinolamine dehydratase, catalyzes the dehydration of the carbinolamine to quinonoid dihydropterin. A decreased rate of dehydration of this compound has been hypothesized to be responsible for the production of 7-biopterin found in certain mildly hyperphenylalaninemic individuals. We have now identified nonsense and missense mutations in the 4a-carbinolamine dehydratase gene in a hyperphenylalaninemic child who excretes large amounts of 7-biopterin. This finding is consistent with the role of the carbinolamine dehydratase in the phenylalanine hydroxylation reaction. Together with previously identified inherited disorders in phenylalanine hydroxylase and dihydropteridine reductase, there are now identified mutations in the three enzymes involved in the phenylalanine hydroxylation system. In addition, the genetics of this system may have broader implications, since the product of the dehydratase gene has previously been shown to play an additional role (as dimerization cofactor for hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 alpha) in the regulation of transcription, through interaction with hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 alpha.",Q16236,Pterin,"['nuclear factor', 'Nuclear factor']","['Pterin', 'Pterin', 'Pterin']",[],[],"['nuclear factor', 'Nuclear factor']","['Pterin', 'Pterin', 'Pterin']"

We showed that SC79 activated Akt and protected H9c2 myocardial cells and primary murine myocardiocytes from OGD/re-oxygenation. Reversely, Akt inhibitor MK-2206 or Akt1 shRNA knockdown almost completely abolished SC79-mediated myocardial cytoprotection. SC79 treatment in H9c2 cells inhibited OGD/re-oxygenation-induced programmed necrosis pathway, evidenced by mitochondrial depolarization and cyclophilin D-p53-ANT-1 (adenine nucleotide translocator 1) association. Further, SC79 activated Akt downstream NF-E2-related factor 2 (NRF2) signaling to suppress OGD/re-oxygenation-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production.

PMC3234879,Interplay between vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor-2 (Nrf2): implications for preeclampsia.,"Several recently published studies have suggested that decreasing VEGF levels result in placental oxidative stress in preeclampsia, although the question as to how decreased VEGF concentrations increase oxidative stress still remains unanswered. Here, we show that VEGF activated Nrf2, the main regulating factor of the intracellular redox balance, in the cytotrophic cell line BeWo. In turn, this activated the production of antioxidative enzymes thioredoxin, thioredoxin reductase, and heme oxygenase-1, which showed a decrease in their expression in the placentas of preeclamptic women. Nevertheless, this activation occurred without oxidative stress stimulus. As a consequence, the activation of Nrf2 protected BeWo cells against H(2)O(2)/Fe(2+)-induced oxidative damage. We further show that VEGF up-regulated the expression of itself. A positive feedback loop was described in which VEGF activated Nrf2 in an ERK1/2-dependent manner; the up-regulation of HO-1 expression by Nrf2 augmented the production of carbon monoxide, which in turn up-regulated VEGF expression. In conclusion, VEGF induces the Nrf2 pathway to protect against oxidative stress and, via a positive feedback loop, to elevate VEGF expression. Therefore, decreased VEGF bioavailability during preeclampsia may result in higher vulnerability to placental oxidative cell damage and a further reduction of VEGF bioavailability, a vicious circle that may end up in preeclampsia.",Q16236,XA,"['Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2', 'nuclear factor', 'NRF2', 'Nuclear factor']",['XA'],['Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2'],[],"['nuclear factor', 'NRF2', 'Nuclear factor']",['XA']

Rat GGT is a single-copy gene from which seven types of GGT mRNA with a common protein encoding sequence, but different 5'-untranslated regions, may be transcribed. We previously showed that type V-2 was the predominant form of GGT mRNA in rat L2 epithelial cells, and that it could be induced by 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) through the electrophile response element (EpRE) located in GGT promoter 5 (GP5). Here, we report transcription factors binding to GP5 EpRE and the involved signaling pathways. Immunodepletion gel shift assays demonstrated that GP5 EpRE bound JunB, c-Jun, FosB, and Fra2 from unstimulated cells, and that after exposure to HNE, EpRE binding complexes contained nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf) 1, Nrf2, JunB, c-Jun, FosB, c-Fos, Fra1, and Fra2. HNE-induced binding of Nrf2 and c-Jun in GP5 EpRE was confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Using reporter assays and specific inhibitors, we found that HNE induction of rat GGT mRNA V-2 was dependent on activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), but not protein kinase C or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Pretreatment with ERK and p38MAPK inhibitors also blocked HNE-increased EpRE binding. HNE-increased nuclear content of Nrf1, Nrf2, and c-Jun in L2 cells was partially blocked by inhibition of either ERK1/2 or p38MAPK and completely blocked by simultaneous inhibition of both MAPKs. In conclusion, HNE induces GGT mRNA V-2 through altered EpRE transcription factor binding mediated by both ERK and p38MAPK.",Q16236,XA,"['Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2', 'nuclear factor', 'NRF2', 'Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2', 'Nuclear factor']",['XA'],['Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2'],[],"['nuclear factor', 'NRF2', 'Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2', 'Nuclear factor']",['XA']

PMC3207433,Phosphorylation of the kinase interaction motif in mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase phosphatase-4 mediates cross-talk between protein kinase A and MAP kinase signaling pathways.,"MAP kinase phosphatase 4 (DUSP9/MKP-4) plays an essential role during placental development and is one of a subfamily of three closely related cytoplasmic dual-specificity MAPK phosphatases, which includes the ERK-specific enzymes DUSP6/MKP-3 and DUSP7/MKP-X. However, unlike DUSP6/MKP-3, DUSP9/MKP-4 also inactivates the p38α MAP kinase both in vitro and in vivo. Here we demonstrate that inactivation of both ERK1/2 and p38α by DUSP9/MKP-4 is mediated by a conserved arginine-rich kinase interaction motif located within the amino-terminal non-catalytic domain of the protein. Furthermore, DUSP9/MKP-4 is unique among these cytoplasmic MKPs in containing a conserved PKA consensus phosphorylation site (55)RRXSer-58 immediately adjacent to the kinase interaction motif. DUSP9/MKP-4 is phosphorylated on Ser-58 by PKA in vitro, and phosphorylation abrogates the binding of DUSP9/MKP-4 to both ERK2 and p38α MAP kinases. In addition, although mutation of Ser-58 to either alanine or glutamic acid does not affect the intrinsic catalytic activity of DUSP9/MKP-4, phospho-mimetic (Ser-58 to Glu) substitution inhibits both the interaction of DUSP9/MKP-4 with ERK2 and p38α in vivo and its ability to dephosphorylate and inactivate these MAP kinases. Finally, the use of a phospho-specific antibody demonstrates that endogenous DUSP9/MKP-4 is phosphorylated on Ser-58 in response to the PKA agonist forskolin and is also modified in placental tissue. We conclude that DUSP9/MKP-4 is a bona fide target of PKA signaling and that attenuation of DUSP9/MKP-4 function can mediate cross-talk between the PKA pathway and MAPK signaling through both ERK1/2 and p38α in vivo.",Q16539,PGA,"['RK', 'p38']",['PGA'],[],[],"['RK', 'p38']",['PGA']

PMC4200820,Synergistic effect of combinatorial treatment with curcumin and mitomycin C on the induction of apoptosis of breast cancer cells: a cDNA microarray analysis.,"In order to explore the synergistic mechanisms of combinatorial treatment using curcumin and mitomycin C (MMC) for breast cancer, MCF-7 breast cancer xenografts were conducted to observe the synergistic effect of combinatorial treatment using curcumin and MMC at various dosages. The synergistic mechanisms of combinatorial treatment using curcumin and MMC on the inhibition of tumor growth were explored by differential gene expression profile, gene ontology (GO), ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) and Signal-Net network analysis. The expression levels of selected genes identified by cDNA microarray expression profiling were validated by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blot analysis. Effect of combinatorial treatment on the inhibition of cell growth was observed by MTT assay. Apoptosis was detected by flow cytometric analysis and Hoechst 33258 staining. The combinatorial treatment of 100 mg/kg curcumin and 1.5 mg/kg MMC revealed synergistic inhibition on tumor growth. Among 1501 differentially expressed genes, the expression of 25 genes exhibited an obvious change and a significant difference in 27 signal pathways was observed (p<0.05). In addition, Mapk1 (ERK) and Mapk14 (MAPK p38) had more cross-interactions with other genes and revealed an increase in expression by 8.14- and 11.84-fold, respectively during the combinatorial treatment by curcumin and MMC when compared with the control. Moreover, curcumin can synergistically improve tumoricidal effect of MMC in another human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells. Apoptosis was significantly induced by the combinatorial treatment (p<0.05) and significantly inhibited by ERK inhibitor (PD98059) in MCF-7 cells (p<0.05). The synergistic effect of combinatorial treatment by curcumin and MMC on the induction of apoptosis in breast cancer cells may be via the ERK pathway.",Q16539,XA,"['RK', 'MAPK14', 'RK', 'p38']",['XA'],['RK'],[],"['MAPK14', 'RK', 'p38']",['XA']

PMC1220651,Stress stimuli increase calcium-induced arachidonic acid release through phosphorylation of cytosolic phospholipase A2.,"Stress stimuli such as free radicals, high osmolarity or arsenite activate stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs) in a wide variety of cells. In the present study, we have investigated the ability of several stress stimuli to activate SAPKs in platelets and to induce phosphorylation of their substrates. Treatment of human platelets with H(2)O(2) stimulated SAPK2a and its downstream target mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase-2 (MAPKAP-K2). Kinase activity reached a maximum after 2-5 min and declined towards basal levels after 15 min. Arsenite caused a steady increase of MAPKAP-K2 activity up to 15 min. The level of maximal kinase activation by H(2)O(2) and arsenite was comparable with the effect caused by the physiological platelet stimulus thrombin. A high osmolarity solution of sorbitol induced comparatively small activation of SAPK2a and MAPKAP-K2. The 42-kDa extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 2 was not activated by H(2)O(2), sorbitol or arsenite. None of these stimuli triggered significant arachidonic acid release on their own. However, H(2)O(2) and sorbitol enhanced the release of arachidonic acid induced by the calcium ionophore A23187. This effect was reversed by the inhibitor of SAPK2a, 4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-(4-methylsulphinylphenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl) imidazole (SB 203580), but not by the inhibitor of the ERK2-activating pathway, 2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-oxanaphthalen-4-one (PD 98059). Both H(2)O(2) and sorbitol increased phosphorylation of cytosolic phospholipase A(2) (cPLA(2)) and its intrinsic activity; both responses were blocked by SB 203580. Phosphorylation of cPLA(2) by H(2)O(2) occurred on Ser-505, a reaction that is known to increase the intrinsic lipase activity of the enzyme. Our results demonstrate that activation of SAPKs by stress stimuli primes cPLA(2) activation through phosphorylation. In vivo, this mechanism would lead to the sensitization of platelet activation and may be an important risk factor in thrombotic disease.",Q16539,XA,"['SAPK2A', 'RK', 'SAPK2a', 'p38']",['XA'],[],[],"['SAPK2A', 'RK', 'SAPK2a', 'p38']",['XA']

PMC2266891,Unique MAP Kinase binding sites.,"Map kinases are drug targets for autoimmune disease, cancer, and apoptosis-related diseases. Drug discovery efforts have developed MAP kinase inhibitors directed toward the ATP binding site and neighboring ""DFG-out"" site, both of which are targets for inhibitors of other protein kinases. On the other hand, MAP kinases have unique substrate and small molecule binding sites that could serve as inhibition sites. The substrate and processing enzyme D-motif binding site is present in all MAP kinases, and has many features of a good small molecule binding site. Further, the MAP kinase p38alpha has a binding site near its C-terminus discovered in crystallographic studies. Finally, the MAP kinases ERK2 and p38alpha have a second substrate binding site, the FXFP binding site that is exposed in active ERK2 and the D-motif peptide induced conformation of MAP kinases. Crystallographic evidence of these latter two binding sites is presented.",Q16539,XA,"['RK', 'p38ALPHA', 'p38']",['XA'],[],[],"['RK', 'p38ALPHA', 'p38']",['XA']
PMC3655899,Delayed and persistent ERK1/2 activation is required for 4-hydroxytamoxifen-induced cell death.,"Tamoxifen (Tam), and its active metabolite, 4-hydroxytamoxifen (OHT), compete with estrogens for binding to the estrogen receptor (ER). Tam and OHT can also induce ER-dependent apoptosis of cancer cells. 10-100nM OHT induces ER-dependent apoptosis in approximately 3 days. Using HeLaER6 cells, we examined the role of OHT activation of signal transduction pathways in OHT-ER-mediated apoptosis. OHT-ER activated the p38, JNK and ERK1/2 pathways. Inhibition of p38 activation with SB203580, or RNAi-knockdown of p38alpha, moderately reduced OHT-ER mediated cell death. A JNK inhibitor partly reduced cell death. Surprisingly, the MEK1/2 inhibitor, PD98059, completely blocked OHT-ER induced apoptosis. EGF, an ERK1/2 activator, enhanced OHT-induced apoptosis. OHT induced a delayed and persistent phosphorylation of ERK1/2 that persisted for >80h. Addition of PD98059 as late as 24h after OHT largely blocked OHT-ER mediated apoptosis. The antagonist, ICI 182,780, blocked both the long-term OHT-mediated phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and OHT-induced apoptosis. Our data suggests that the p38 and JNK pathways, which often play a central role in apoptosis, have only a limited role in OHT-ER-mediated cell death. Although rapid activation of the ERK1/2 pathway is often associated with cell growth, persistent activation of the ERK1/2 pathway is essential for OHT-ER induced cell death.",Q16539,XA,"['RK', 'RK', 'p38']",['XA'],['RK'],[],"['RK', 'p38']",['XA']

PMC1136064,The activation of distinct mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades is required for the stimulation of 2-deoxyglucose uptake by interleukin-1 and insulin-like growth factor-1 in KB cells.,"The uptake of 2-deoxyglucose into KB cells was stimulated about 2-fold by interleukin-1 (IL1), anisomycin or insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1). Stimulation by IL1 and anisomycin was prevented by SB 203580, a specific inhibitor of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase homologue termed 're-activating kinase' [RK; also known as p38, p40 and CSBP (cytokine synthesis anti-inflammatory-drug-binding protein)], but was unaffected by PD 98059, a specific inhibitor of the activation of the classical MAP kinase pathway. In contrast, the stimulation of 2-deoxyglucose uptake by IGF1 was blocked by PD 98059 and unaffected by SB 203580. Consistent with these observations, IL1 and anisomycin were potent activators of MAP kinase-activated protein (MAPKAP) kinase-2, a physiological substrate of RK, whereas IGF1 was only a very weak activator of MAPKAP kinase-2. Conversely, IGF1 was a stronger activator of p42 MAP kinase than IL1 or anisomycin. These results imply that the activation of distinct MAP kinase pathways is required for the stimulation of glucose transport by IL1/anisomycin and IGF1 in KB cells, and suggest that the combined use of SB 203580 and PD 98059 is a powerful new approach to explore the roles of different MAP kinase cascades in cell regulation.",Q16539,XA,"['mitogen-activated protein kinase 14', 'RK', 'CSBP', 'p38']",['XA'],['mitogen-activated protein kinase 14'],[],"['RK', 'CSBP', 'p38']",['XA']
