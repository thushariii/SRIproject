PMC10530627,Synergistic interactions of cytarabine-adavosertib in leukemic cell lines proliferation and metabolomic endpoints.,"Drug synergy allows reduced dosing, side effects and tolerance. Optimization of drug synergy chemotherapy is fundamental in acute lymphocytic leukemia and other cancers. This study aimed to analyze the pharmacodynamic synergy between the anti-metabolite cytarabine and WEE1 inhibitor adavosertib on acute leukemia cell lines CCRF-CEM and Jurkat. In both cell lines analysis of concentration-inhibition curves of adavosertib-cytarabine combinations and synergy matrixes supported mutually synergistic drug interactions. Overall mean ( ± SD) synergy scores were higher in Jurkat than CCRF-CEM: Jurkat, ZIP 22.51 ± 1.1, Bliss 22.49 ± 1.1, HSA 23.44 ± 1.0, Loewe 14.16 ± 1.2; and, CCRF-CEM, ZIP 9.17 ± 1.9, Bliss 8.13 ± 2.1, HSA 11.48 ± 1.9 and Loewe 4.99 ± 1.8. Jurkat also surpassed CCRF-CEM in high-degree synergistic adavosertib-cytarabine interactions with mean across-models synergy values of ∼89.1% ± 2.9 for 63 nM cytarabine-97 nM adavosertib (91.4% inhibition synergy barometer). Combination sensitivity scores scatter plots confirmed combination's synergy efficacy. This combined approach permitted identification and prioritization of 63 nM cytarabine-97 nM adavosertib for multiple endpoints analysis. This combination did not affect PBMC viability, while exhibiting Jurkat selective synergy. Immunoblots also revealed Jurkat selective synergistically increased γH2AX phosphorylation, while CDC2 phosphorylation effects were attributed to adavosertib's WEE1 inhibition. In conclusion, the high synergistic efficacy combination of cytarabine (63 nM) and adavosertib (97 nM) was associated with remarkable alterations in metabolites related to the Krebs cycle in Jurkat. The metabolic pathways and processes are related to gluconeogenesis, amino acids, nucleotides, glutathione, electron transport and Warburg effect.

PMC10669250,A Network Pharmacology and Molecular-Docking-Based Approach to Identify the Probable Targets of Short-Chain Fatty-Acid-Producing Microbial Metabolites against Kidney Cancer and Inflammation.,"(1) Background: A large and diverse microbial population exists in the human intestinal tract, which supports gut homeostasis and the health of the host. Short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-secreting microbes also generate several metabolites with favorable regulatory effects on various malignancies and immunological inflammations. The involvement of intestinal SCFAs in kidney diseases, such as various kidney malignancies and inflammations, has emerged as a fascinating area of study in recent years. However, the mechanisms of SCFAs and other metabolites produced by SCFA-producing bacteria against kidney cancer and inflammation have not yet been investigated. (2) Methods: We considered 177 different SCFA-producing microbial species and 114 metabolites from the gutMgene database. Further, we used different online-based database platforms to predict 1890 gene targets associated with metabolites. Moreover, DisGeNET, OMIM, and Genecard databases were used to consider 13,104 disease-related gene targets. We used a Venn diagram and various protein-protein interactions (PPIs), KEGG pathways, and GO analyses for the functional analysis of gene targets. Moreover, the subnetwork of protein-protein interactions (through string and cytoscape platforms) was used to select the top 20% of gene targets through degree centrality, betweenness centrality, and closeness centrality. To screen the possible candidate compounds, we performed an analysis of the ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity) properties of metabolites and then found the best binding affinity using molecular docking simulation. (3) Results: Finally, we found the key gene targets that interact with suitable compounds and function against kidney cancer and inflammation, such as MTOR (with glycocholic acid), PIK3CA (with 11-methoxycurvularin, glycocholic acid, and isoquercitrin), IL6 (with isoquercitrin), PTGS2 (with isoquercitrin), and IGF1R (with 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b] pyridine, isoquercitrin), showed a lower binding affinity.

Therefore, the purpose of the present studies was to investigate the anti-fibrotic effects of BUT on PF by serum metabolomics and the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) pathway. Sixty male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into control, untreated PF, prednisone-treated (5 mg/kg), and BUT-treated (1.75, 1.25, 0.75 g/kg) groups, and the respective drugs were administered intragastrically for 21 days.
