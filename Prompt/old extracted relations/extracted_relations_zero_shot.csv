PMC10530627,Synergistic interactions of cytarabine-adavosertib in leukemic cell lines proliferation and metabolomic endpoints.,"Drug synergy allows reduced dosing, side effects and tolerance. Optimization of drug synergy chemotherapy is fundamental in acute lymphocytic leukemia and other cancers. This study aimed to analyze the pharmacodynamic synergy between the anti-metabolite cytarabine and WEE1 inhibitor adavosertib on acute leukemia cell lines CCRF-CEM and Jurkat. In both cell lines analysis of concentration-inhibition curves of adavosertib-cytarabine combinations and synergy matrixes supported mutually synergistic drug interactions. Overall mean ( ± SD) synergy scores were higher in Jurkat than CCRF-CEM: Jurkat, ZIP 22.51 ± 1.1, Bliss 22.49 ± 1.1, HSA 23.44 ± 1.0, Loewe 14.16 ± 1.2; and, CCRF-CEM, ZIP 9.17 ± 1.9, Bliss 8.13 ± 2.1, HSA 11.48 ± 1.9 and Loewe 4.99 ± 1.8. Jurkat also surpassed CCRF-CEM in high-degree synergistic adavosertib-cytarabine interactions with mean across-models synergy values of ∼89.1% ± 2.9 for 63 nM cytarabine-97 nM adavosertib (91.4% inhibition synergy barometer).

PMC10669250,A Network Pharmacology and Molecular-Docking-Based Approach to Identify the Probable Targets of Short-Chain Fatty-Acid-Producing Microbial Metabolites against Kidney Cancer and Inflammation.,"(1) Background: A large and diverse microbial population exists in the human intestinal tract, which supports gut homeostasis and the health of the host. Short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-secreting microbes also generate several metabolites with favorable regulatory effects on various malignancies and immunological inflammations. The involvement of intestinal SCFAs in kidney diseases, such as various kidney malignancies and inflammations, has emerged as a fascinating area of study in recent years. However, the mechanisms of SCFAs and other metabolites produced by SCFA-producing bacteria against kidney cancer and inflammation have not yet been investigated. (2) Methods: We considered 177 different SCFA-producing microbial species and 114 metabolites from the gutMgene database. Further, we used different online-based database platforms to predict 1890 gene targets associated with metabolites. Moreover, DisGeNET, OMIM, and Genecard databases were used to consider 13,104 disease-related gene targets. We used a Venn diagram and various protein-protein interactions (PPIs), KEGG pathways, and GO analyses for the functional analysis of gene targets. Moreover, the subnetwork of protein-protein interactions (through string and cytoscape platforms) was used to select the top 20% of gene targets through degree centrality, betweenness centrality, and closeness centrality. To screen the possible candidate compounds, we performed an analysis of the ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity) properties of metabolites and then found the best binding affinity using molecular docking simulation. (3) Results: Finally, we found the key gene targets that interact with suitable compounds and function against kidney cancer and inflammation, such as MTOR (with glycocholic acid), PIK3CA (with 11-methoxycurvularin, glycocholic acid, and isoquercitrin), IL6 (with isoquercitrin), PTGS2 (with isoquercitrin), and IGF1R (with 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b] pyridine, isoquercitrin), showed a lower binding affinity.

Therefore, the purpose of the present studies was to investigate the anti-fibrotic effects of BUT on PF by serum metabolomics and the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) pathway.

PMC11001995,Dermal injury drives a skin to gut axis that disrupts the intestinal microbiome and intestinal immune homeostasis in mice.,"The composition of the microbial community in the intestine may influence the functions of distant organs such as the brain, lung, and skin. These microbes can promote disease or have beneficial functions, leading to the hypothesis that microbes in the gut explain the co-occurrence of intestinal and skin diseases. Here, we show that the reverse can occur, and that skin directly alters the gut microbiome. Disruption of the dermis by skin wounding or the digestion of dermal hyaluronan results in increased expression in the colon of the host defense genes Reg3 and Muc2, and skin wounding changes the composition and behavior of intestinal bacteria. Enhanced expression Reg3 and Muc2 is induced in vitro by exposure to hyaluronan released by these skin interventions. The change in the colon microbiome after skin wounding is functionally important as these bacteria penetrate the intestinal epithelium and enhance colitis from dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) as seen by the ability to rescue skin associated DSS colitis with oral antibiotics, in germ-free mice, and fecal microbiome transplantation to unwounded mice from mice with skin wounds.

PMC11048093,Postnatal Growth and Development of the Rumen: Integrating Physiological and Molecular Insights.,"The rumen plays an essential role in the physiology and production of agriculturally important ruminants such as cattle. Functions of the rumen include fermentation, absorption, metabolism, and protection. Cattle are, however, not born with a functional rumen, and the rumen undergoes considerable changes in size, histology, physiology, and transcriptome from birth to adulthood. In this review, we discuss these changes in detail, the factors that affect these changes, and the potential molecular and cellular mechanisms that mediate these changes. The introduction of solid feed to the rumen is essential for rumen growth and functional development in post-weaning calves. Increasing evidence suggests that solid feed stimulates rumen growth and functional development through butyric acid and other volatile fatty acids (VFAs) produced by microbial fermentation of feed in the rumen and that VFAs stimulate rumen growth and functional development through hormones such as insulin and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) or through direct actions on energy production, chromatin modification, and gene expression. Given the role of the rumen in ruminant physiology and performance, it is important to further study the cellular, molecular, genomic, and epigenomic mechanisms that control rumen growth and development in postnatal ruminants. A better understanding of these mechanisms could lead to the development of novel strategies to enhance the growth and development of the rumen and thereby the productivity and health of cattle and other agriculturally important ruminants.",P05019,PCA,"['Insulin-like growth factor I', 'IGF-I', 'IGF', 'IGF1']",['PCA'],[],[],"['Insulin-like growth factor I', 'IGF-I', 'IGF', 'IGF1']",['PCA'],,135403803,"The document discusses the role of volatile fatty acids (VFAs), particularly butyric acid, in the development of the rumen in postnatal ruminants.
