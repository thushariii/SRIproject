        "Abstract": "We have generated fusion proteins between vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and the bacterial enzyme carboxypeptidase G2 (CPG2) that can activate the prodrug 4-[(2-chloroethyl)(2-mesyloxyethyl)amino]benzoyl-L-glutamic acid (CMDA). Three asparagine residues of CPG2 were mutated to glutamine (CPG2(Q)3) to prevent glycosylation during secretion, and truncations of VEGF(165) were fused to either the C- or N-terminal of CPG2. The K(m) of the fusion proteins (37.5 microM) was similar to that of secreted CPG2(Q)3 (29.5 microM) but greater than that of wild-type CPG2 (8 microM). The affinity of the fusion proteins for VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR2) (K(d)=0.5-1.1 nM) was similar to that of [(125)I]VEGF (K(d)=0.5 nM) (ELISA) or slightly higher (K(d)=1.3-9.6 nM) (competitive RIA). One protein, VEGF(115)-CPG2(Q)3-H(6), possessed 140% of the enzymic activity of secreted CPG2(Q)3, and had a faster half-maximal binding time for VEGFR2 (77 s), than the other candidates (330 s). In vitro, VEGF(115)-CPG2(Q)3-H(6) targeted CMDA cytotoxicity only towards VEGFR-expressing cells. The plasma half-life of VEGF(115)-CPG2(Q)3-H(6) in vivo was 3 h, comparable to equivalent values observed in ADEPT. We conclude that enzyme prodrug therapy using VEGF as a targeting moiety represents a promising novel antitumour therapy, with VEGF(115)-CPG2(Q)3-H(6) being a lead candidate.",
