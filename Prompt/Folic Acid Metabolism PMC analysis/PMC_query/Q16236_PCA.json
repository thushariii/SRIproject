        "Abstract": "Radiation-induced lung injury (RILI) is a common and fatal complication of chest radiotherapy. The underlying mechanisms include radiation-induced oxidative stress caused by damage to the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), resulting in apoptosis of lung and endothelial cells and recruitment of inflammatory cells and myofibroblasts expressing NADPH oxidase to the site of injury, which in turn contribute to oxidative stress and cytokine production. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2) is a vital transcription factor that regulates oxidative stress and inhibits inflammation. Studies have shown that Nrf-2 protects against radiation-induced lung inflammation and fibrosis. This review discusses the protective role of Nrf-2 in RILI and its possible mechanisms.",

        "Abstract": "Inflammatory processes are often accompanied by oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation, which might lead to cellular and organ damage. Carnosic acid (CA), an active component found in rosemary, exhibits pharmacological properties including antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and antiviral effects. The aim of this research was to investigate whether CA can mitigate lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced oxidative stress and inflammatory responses in poultry and to understand its underlying mechanisms. We administered CA to broiler chickens via oral gavage and treated them with LPS, followed by analysis of the effects of different dosages of CA on body weight, antioxidative capacity, and inflammatory factors. Carnosic acid had no significant impact on the body weight of broiler chickens. However, serum analysis indicated that the middle dose of CA effectively enhanced the antioxidative capacity and reduced levels of oxidative stress and inflammation-related factors. Moreover, in the liver, CA demonstrated the ability to regulate the expression of proteins such as heat shock protein 60 (HSP60), heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), and P38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (P38), suggesting its protective role against liver damage induced by LPS. In the intestinal tract of broiler chickens, CA regulated the expression and localization of proteins including HSP60, HSP70, NFE2 like bZIP transcription factor 2 (Nrf2), and P38, while also influencing the expression of inflammatory markers such as protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type C (CD45), and connexin (Cx). These findings revealed the potential protective mechanisms of CA in alleviating oxidative stress and inflammatory damage induced by LPS in poultry. Carnosic acid notably enhanced the chickens' antioxidative capacity by modulating the expression of key proteins, thereby reducing oxidative stress and inflammatory response levels. This study provides a deeper comprehension of the protective mechanisms of CA and its potential impact on avian health.",

This study focuses on the evaluation of stabilizing effects on the synthetic triterpenoid TX101, a cyanoenone triterpenoid Nrf2 activator with known instability in plasma samples. The molecule's unsaturated double bond is susceptible to oxidation, either nonenzymatically via oxygen or enzymatically through cytochrome P450 enzyme-catalyzed epoxidation. The research explores the impact of antioxidants (L-ascorbic acid, sodium metabisulfite, sodium sulfite) and P450 enzyme inhibitors (sodium diethyldithiocarbamate, memantine hydrochloride, 1-aminobenzotriazole) on TX101 stability in rat plasma samples. Results reveal that adding 2.5 mg/mL sodium sulfite or sodium metabisulfite effectively inhibits the nonenzymatic oxidation of TX101 to TX101-epoxide, while L-ascorbic acid shows minimal stabilizing effect. Among P450 enzyme inhibitors, sodium diethyldithiocarbamate and memantine hydrochloride exhibit modest stabilizing effects, likely attributed to their antioxidant activity. The developed High-formance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method, incorporating Supported Liquid Extraction for sample cleanup, allows simultaneous monitoring of TX101 and TX101-epoxide. Application of this method in a rat dose-range finding study confirms successful inhibition of TX101-epoxide formation in samples treated with sodium sulfite or sodium metabisulfite.

        "Abstract": "Diabetes significantly increases the risk of heart failure by inducing myocardial cell death, potentially through ferroptosis-an iron-dependent, non-apoptotic cell death pathway characterized by lipid peroxidation. The role of cardiac ferroptosis in human heart failure, however, remains poorly understood. In this study, we compared cardiac ferroptosis in humans with diabetic heart failure to that in healthy controls. Our findings reveal that diabetes not only intensifies myocardial cell death but also upregulates markers of ferroptosis in human hearts. This is linked to decreased transcription and activity of glutathione peroxidase-4 (GPX4), influenced by reduced levels of activating transcription factor-4 (ATF4) and nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor-2 (NRF2), and downregulation of glutathione reductase (GSR). Additionally, diabetic hearts showed an increased labile iron pool due to enhanced heme metabolism by heme oxygenase-1 (HMOX1), elevated iron import via divalent metal transporter-1 (DMT1), reduced iron storage through ferritin light chain (FLC), and decreased iron export via ferroportin-1 (FPN1). The reduction in FPN1 levels likely results from decreased stabilization by amyloid precursor protein (APP) and diminished NRF2-mediated transcription. Furthermore, diabetes upregulates lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase-3 (LPCAT3), facilitating the integration of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) into phospholipid membranes, and downregulates acyl-CoA thioesterase-1 (ACOT1), which further promotes ferroptosis. LC-MS/MS analysis identified several novel proteins implicated in diabetes-induced cardiac ferroptosis, including upregulated ceruloplasmin, which enhances iron metabolism, and cytochrome b-245 heavy chain (CYBB), a key component of NADPH oxidase that aids in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), along with downregulated voltage-dependent anion-selective channel protein-2 (VDAC2), essential for maintaining mitochondrial membrane potential. In conclusion, our study not only confirms the presence and potentially predominant role of cardiac ferroptosis in humans with diabetic heart failure but also elucidates its molecular mechanisms, offering potential therapeutic targets to mitigate heart failure complications in diabetic patients.",

        "Abstract": "Satureja is an aromatic plant that is used for flavoring, perfume, and food manufacturing due to its pleasant essential oil. Modern medicine research revealed several biological activities of Satureja essential oil, including antifungal, antibacterial, antiviral, antioxidant, anticancer, and anti-inflammatory. However, the functional properties of Satureja fatty acid have not been explored. This study examined the fatty acid profile, lipid nutritional quality, antioxidant, anti-amylase, and anti-lipase capacities of Satureja. The efficiency of Satureja fatty acid on the anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory parameters in LPS-induced macrophage through the Nrf2/NF-kB/NADH oxidase pathway was examined. The whole lipid extract was prepared with chloroform/methanol/water solution. Fatty acids methyl ester from whole lipid extract were prepared with methanol/sulfuric acid reagent. The fatty acid profile was analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Total antioxidant was determined by ABTS decolorization. Lipase and amylase activities were determined by monitoring the decomposition of p-nitrophenyl butyrate and starch. The macrophage cell line was grown in DMEM media in the presence of fatty acid. The hydrogen peroxide production in treated cells was monitored using the FOX reagent. NADH oxidase activity was measured by monitoring NADH breakdown. The expression of NOX, NF-kB, and NRF2, were tested in the treated cells by real-time PCR. The main components of the Satureja fatty acid were linolenic acid (24.67-37.32%), palmitic acid (10.65-20.29%), linoleic acid (8.31-13.39%), oleic acid (4.42-14.35%), stearic acid (2.76-8.77%) and palmitoleic acid (1.77-4.95%). Given the nutritional quality, omega-3 PUFA (23.58-37.32%), SFA (21.53-26.70%), omega-6 PUFA (10.86-16.14%), omega-9 MUFA (4.42-14.35%), and omega-7 MUFA (1.77-4.95%) comprise the majority of fatty acids. Satureja fatty acid has a promising unsaturation index (120.77-164.27), PUFA/MUFA (2.07-6.41), hypocholesterolemic index (2.44-3.47), health-promoting index (2.03-2.42), PUFA/SFA (1.37-1.94), nutritive value index (0.53-1.71), MUFA/SFA (0.30-0.80) omega-6/omega-3 (0.34-0.65), atherogenicity index (0.41-0.49), and thrombogenicity index (0.17-0.27).

In conclusion, our study not only confirms the presence and potentially predominant role of cardiac ferroptosis in humans with diabetic heart failure but also elucidates its molecular mechanisms, offering potential therapeutic targets to mitigate heart failure complications in diabetic patients.",

Modern medicine research revealed several biological activities of Satureja essential oil, including antifungal, antibacterial, antiviral, antioxidant, anticancer, and anti-inflammatory. However, the functional properties of Satureja fatty acid have not been explored. This study examined the fatty acid profile, lipid nutritional quality, antioxidant, anti-amylase, and anti-lipase capacities of Satureja. The efficiency of Satureja fatty acid on the anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory parameters in LPS-induced macrophage through the Nrf2/NF-kB/NADH oxidase pathway was examined. The whole lipid extract was prepared with chloroform/methanol/water solution. Fatty acids methyl ester from whole lipid extract were prepared with methanol/sulfuric acid reagent. The fatty acid profile was analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Total antioxidant was determined by ABTS decolorization. Lipase and amylase activities were determined by monitoring the decomposition of p-nitrophenyl butyrate and starch. The macrophage cell line was grown in DMEM media in the presence of fatty acid. The hydrogen peroxide production in treated cells was monitored using the FOX reagent. NADH oxidase activity was measured by monitoring NADH breakdown. The expression of NOX, NF-kB, and NRF2, were tested in the treated cells by real-time PCR. The main components of the Satureja fatty acid were linolenic acid (24.67-37.32%), palmitic acid (10.65-20.29%), linoleic acid (8.31-13.39%), oleic acid (4.42-14.35%), stearic acid (2.76-8.77%) and palmitoleic acid (1.77-4.95%).

        "Abstract": "In the development of bioanalytical methods, stabilizing drug molecules in biological matrices is crucial for ensuring reliable exposure data in pharmacokinetic and toxicokinetic sample analyses. This study focuses on the evaluation of stabilizing effects on the synthetic triterpenoid TX101, a cyanoenone triterpenoid Nrf2 activator with known instability in plasma samples. The molecule's unsaturated double bond is susceptible to oxidation, either nonenzymatically via oxygen or enzymatically through cytochrome P450 enzyme-catalyzed epoxidation. The research explores the impact of antioxidants (L-ascorbic acid, sodium metabisulfite, sodium sulfite) and P450 enzyme inhibitors (sodium diethyldithiocarbamate, memantine hydrochloride, 1-aminobenzotriazole) on TX101 stability in rat plasma samples. Results reveal that adding 2.5 mg/mL sodium sulfite or sodium metabisulfite effectively inhibits the nonenzymatic oxidation of TX101 to TX101-epoxide, while L-ascorbic acid shows minimal stabilizing effect. Among P450 enzyme inhibitors, sodium diethyldithiocarbamate and memantine hydrochloride exhibit modest stabilizing effects, likely attributed to their antioxidant activity. The developed High-formance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method, incorporating Supported Liquid Extraction for sample cleanup, allows simultaneous monitoring of TX101 and TX101-epoxide. Application of this method in a rat dose-range finding study confirms successful inhibition of TX101-epoxide formation in samples treated with sodium sulfite or sodium metabisulfite. Overall, the study emphasizes the importance of stabilizers in preventing nonenzymatic oxidation reactions during sample storage, providing valuable insights for bioanalytical method development and validation.",

        "Abstract": "Diabetes significantly increases the risk of heart failure by inducing myocardial cell death, potentially through ferroptosis-an iron-dependent, non-apoptotic cell death pathway characterized by lipid peroxidation. The role of cardiac ferroptosis in human heart failure, however, remains poorly understood. In this study, we compared cardiac ferroptosis in humans with diabetic heart failure to that in healthy controls. Our findings reveal that diabetes not only intensifies myocardial cell death but also upregulates markers of ferroptosis in human hearts. This is linked to decreased transcription and activity of glutathione peroxidase-4 (GPX4), influenced by reduced levels of activating transcription factor-4 (ATF4) and nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor-2 (NRF2), and downregulation of glutathione reductase (GSR). Additionally, diabetic hearts showed an increased labile iron pool due to enhanced heme metabolism by heme oxygenase-1 (HMOX1), elevated iron import via divalent metal transporter-1 (DMT1), reduced iron storage through ferritin light chain (FLC), and decreased iron export via ferroportin-1 (FPN1). The reduction in FPN1 levels likely results from decreased stabilization by amyloid precursor protein (APP) and diminished NRF2-mediated transcription. Furthermore, diabetes upregulates lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase-3 (LPCAT3), facilitating the integration of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) into phospholipid membranes, and downregulates acyl-CoA thioesterase-1 (ACOT1), which further promotes ferroptosis.

        "Abstract": "Diabetes significantly increases the risk of heart failure by inducing myocardial cell death, potentially through ferroptosis-an iron-dependent, non-apoptotic cell death pathway characterized by lipid peroxidation. The role of cardiac ferroptosis in human heart failure, however, remains poorly understood. In this study, we compared cardiac ferroptosis in humans with diabetic heart failure to that in healthy controls. Our findings reveal that diabetes not only intensifies myocardial cell death but also upregulates markers of ferroptosis in human hearts. This is linked to decreased transcription and activity of glutathione peroxidase-4 (GPX4), influenced by reduced levels of activating transcription factor-4 (ATF4) and nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor-2 (NRF2), and downregulation of glutathione reductase (GSR). Additionally, diabetic hearts showed an increased labile iron pool due to enhanced heme metabolism by heme oxygenase-1 (HMOX1), elevated iron import via divalent metal transporter-1 (DMT1), reduced iron storage through ferritin light chain (FLC), and decreased iron export via ferroportin-1 (FPN1). The reduction in FPN1 levels likely results from decreased stabilization by amyloid precursor protein (APP) and diminished NRF2-mediated transcription. Furthermore, diabetes upregulates lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase-3 (LPCAT3), facilitating the integration of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) into phospholipid membranes, and downregulates acyl-CoA thioesterase-1 (ACOT1), which further promotes ferroptosis. LC-MS/MS analysis identified several novel proteins implicated in diabetes-induced cardiac ferroptosis, including upregulated ceruloplasmin, which enhances iron metabolism, and cytochrome b-245 heavy chain (CYBB), a key component of NADPH oxidase that aids in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), along with downregulated voltage-dependent anion-selective channel protein-2 (VDAC2), essential for maintaining mitochondrial membrane potential. In conclusion, our study not only confirms the presence and potentially predominant role of cardiac ferroptosis in humans with diabetic heart failure but also elucidates its molecular mechanisms, offering potential therapeutic targets to mitigate heart failure complications in diabetic patients.",

        "Abstract": "Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a common cerebral vascular disease with high incidence, disability, and mortality. Ferroptosis is a regulated type of iron-dependent, non-apoptotic programmed cell death. There is increasing evidence that ferroptosis may lead to neuronal damage mediated by hemorrhagic stroke mediated neuronal damage. Salvianolic acid A (SAA) is a natural bioactive polyphenol compound extracted from salvia miltiorrhiza, which has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antifibrosis activities. SAA is reported to be an iron chelator that inhibits lipid peroxidation and provides neuroprotective effects. However, whether SAA improves neuronal ferroptosis mediated by hemorrhagic stroke remains unclear. The study aims to evaluate the therapeutic effect of SAA on Ferroptosis mediated by Intracerebral hemorrhage and explore its potential mechanisms. We constructed in vivo and in vitro models of intracerebral hemorrhage in rats. Multiple methods were used to analyze the inhibitory effect of SAA on ferroptosis in both in vivo and in vitro models of intracerebral hemorrhage in rats. Then, network pharmacology is used to identify potential targets and mechanisms for SAA treatment of ICH. The SAA target ICH network combines SAA and ICH targets with protein-protein interactions (PPIs). Find the specific mechanism of SAA acting on ferroptosis through molecular docking and functional enrichment analysis. In rats, SAA (10 mg/kg in vivo and 50 μM in vitro, p < 0.05) alleviated dyskinesia and brain injury in the ICH model by inhibiting ferroptosis (p < 0.05). The molecular docking results and functional enrichment analyses suggested that AKT (V-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog) could mediate the effect of SAA. NRF2 (Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2) was a potential target of SAA. Our further experiments showed that salvianolic acid A enhanced the Akt /GSK-3β/Nrf2 signaling pathway activation in vivo and in vitro. At the same time, SAA significantly expanded the expression of GPX4, XCT proteins, and the nuclear expression of Nrf2, while the AKT inhibitor SH-6 and the Nrf2 inhibitor ML385 could reduce them to some extent. Therefore, SAA effectively ameliorated ICH-mediated neuronal ferroptosis. Meanwhile, one of the critical mechanisms of SAA inhibiting ferroptosis was activating the Akt/GSK-3β/Nrf2 signaling pathway.",

        "Abstract": "The toxicity of inhaled particulate air pollution perseveres even at lower concentrations than those of the existing air quality limit. Therefore, the identification of safe and effective measures against pollutant particles-induced vascular toxicity is warranted. Carnosol is a bioactive phenolic diterpene found in rosemary herb, with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant actions. However, its possible protective effect on the thrombotic and vascular injury induced by diesel exhaust particles (DEP) has not been studied before. We assessed here the potential alleviating effect of carnosol (20 mg/kg) administered intraperitoneally 1 h before intratracheal (i.t.) instillation of DEP (20 μg/mouse). Twenty-four hours after the administration of DEP, various parameters were assessed. Carnosol administration prevented the increase in the plasma concentrations of C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, and tissue factor induced by DEP exposure. Carnosol inhibited DEP-induced prothrombotic effects in pial microvessels in vivo and platelet aggregation in vitro. The shortening of activated partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin time induced by DEP was abated by carnosol administration. Carnosol inhibited the increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor α) and adhesion molecules (intercellular adhesion molecule-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, E-selectin, and P-selectin) in aortic tissue. Moreover, it averted the effects of DEP-induced increase of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, depletion of antioxidants and DNA damage in the aortic tissue. Likewise, carnosol prevented the decrease in the expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) caused by DEP. We conclude that carnosol alleviates DEP-induced thrombogenicity and vascular inflammation, oxidative damage, and DNA injury through Nrf2 and HO-1 activation.",

The molecular docking results and functional enrichment analyses suggested that AKT (V-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog) could mediate the effect of SAA. NRF2 (Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2) was a potential target of SAA. Our further experiments showed that salvianolic acid A enhanced the Akt /GSK-3β/Nrf2 signaling pathway activation in vivo and in vitro. At the same time, SAA significantly expanded the expression of GPX4, XCT proteins, and the nuclear expression of Nrf2, while the AKT inhibitor SH-6 and the Nrf2 inhibitor ML385 could reduce them to some extent. Therefore, SAA effectively ameliorated ICH-mediated neuronal ferroptosis. Meanwhile, one of the critical mechanisms of SAA inhibiting ferroptosis was activating the Akt/GSK-3β/Nrf2 signaling pathway.",

Therefore, the identification of safe and effective measures against pollutant particles-induced vascular toxicity is warranted. Carnosol is a bioactive phenolic diterpene found in rosemary herb, with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant actions. However, its possible protective effect on the thrombotic and vascular injury induced by diesel exhaust particles (DEP) has not been studied before. We assessed here the potential alleviating effect of carnosol (20 mg/kg) administered intraperitoneally 1 h before intratracheal (i.t.) instillation of DEP (20 μg/mouse). Twenty-four hours after the administration of DEP, various parameters were assessed. Carnosol administration prevented the increase in the plasma concentrations of C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, and tissue factor induced by DEP exposure. Carnosol inhibited DEP-induced prothrombotic effects in pial microvessels in vivo and platelet aggregation in vitro. The shortening of activated partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin time induced by DEP was abated by carnosol administration. Carnosol inhibited the increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor α) and adhesion molecules (intercellular adhesion molecule-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, E-selectin, and P-selectin) in aortic tissue. Moreover, it averted the effects of DEP-induced increase of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, depletion of antioxidants and DNA damage in the aortic tissue. Likewise, carnosol prevented the decrease in the expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) caused by DEP. We conclude that carnosol alleviates DEP-induced thrombogenicity and vascular inflammation, oxidative damage, and DNA injury through Nrf2 and HO-1 activation.",

        "Abstract": "Diabetes significantly increases the risk of heart failure by inducing myocardial cell death, potentially through ferroptosis-an iron-dependent, non-apoptotic cell death pathway characterized by lipid peroxidation. The role of cardiac ferroptosis in human heart failure, however, remains poorly understood. In this study, we compared cardiac ferroptosis in humans with diabetic heart failure to that in healthy controls. Our findings reveal that diabetes not only intensifies myocardial cell death but also upregulates markers of ferroptosis in human hearts. This is linked to decreased transcription and activity of glutathione peroxidase-4 (GPX4), influenced by reduced levels of activating transcription factor-4 (ATF4) and nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor-2 (NRF2), and downregulation of glutathione reductase (GSR). Additionally, diabetic hearts showed an increased labile iron pool due to enhanced heme metabolism by heme oxygenase-1 (HMOX1), elevated iron import via divalent metal transporter-1 (DMT1), reduced iron storage through ferritin light chain (FLC), and decreased iron export via ferroportin-1 (FPN1). The reduction in FPN1 levels likely results from decreased stabilization by amyloid precursor protein (APP) and diminished NRF2-mediated transcription. Furthermore, diabetes upregulates lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase-3 (LPCAT3), facilitating the integration of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) into phospholipid membranes, and downregulates acyl-CoA thioesterase-1 (ACOT1), which further promotes ferroptosis. LC-MS/MS analysis identified several novel proteins implicated in diabetes-induced cardiac ferroptosis, including upregulated ceruloplasmin, which enhances iron metabolism, and cytochrome b-245 heavy chain (CYBB), a key component of NADPH oxidase that aids in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), along with downregulated voltage-dependent anion-selective channel protein-2 (VDAC2), essential for maintaining mitochondrial membrane potential. In conclusion, our study not only confirms the presence and potentially predominant role of cardiac ferroptosis in humans with diabetic heart failure but also elucidates its molecular mechanisms, offering potential therapeutic targets to mitigate heart failure complications in diabetic patients.",

        "Abstract": "Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a common cerebral vascular disease with high incidence, disability, and mortality. Ferroptosis is a regulated type of iron-dependent, non-apoptotic programmed cell death. There is increasing evidence that ferroptosis may lead to neuronal damage mediated by hemorrhagic stroke mediated neuronal damage. Salvianolic acid A (SAA) is a natural bioactive polyphenol compound extracted from salvia miltiorrhiza, which has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antifibrosis activities. SAA is reported to be an iron chelator that inhibits lipid peroxidation and provides neuroprotective effects. However, whether SAA improves neuronal ferroptosis mediated by hemorrhagic stroke remains unclear. The study aims to evaluate the therapeutic effect of SAA on Ferroptosis mediated by Intracerebral hemorrhage and explore its potential mechanisms. We constructed in vivo and in vitro models of intracerebral hemorrhage in rats. Multiple methods were used to analyze the inhibitory effect of SAA on ferroptosis in both in vivo and in vitro models of intracerebral hemorrhage in rats. Then, network pharmacology is used to identify potential targets and mechanisms for SAA treatment of ICH. The SAA target ICH network combines SAA and ICH targets with protein-protein interactions (PPIs). Find the specific mechanism of SAA acting on ferroptosis through molecular docking and functional enrichment analysis. In rats, SAA (10 mg/kg in vivo and 50 μM in vitro, p < 0.05) alleviated dyskinesia and brain injury in the ICH model by inhibiting ferroptosis (p < 0.05).
