        "Abstract": "B vitamins involved in one-carbon metabolism have been implicated in the development of inflammation- and angiogenesis-related chronic diseases, such as colorectal cancer (CRC). Yet, the role of one-carbon metabolism in inflammation and angiogenesis among CRC patients remains unclear. The objective of this study was to investigate associations of components of one-carbon metabolism with inflammation and angiogenesis biomarkers among newly diagnosed CRC patients (n 238) in the prospective ColoCare Study, Heidelberg. We cross-sectionally analysed associations between twelve B vitamins and one-carbon metabolites and ten inflammation and angiogenesis biomarkers from pre-surgery serum samples using multivariable linear regression models. We further explored associations among novel biomarkers in these pathways with Spearman partial correlation analyses. We hypothesised that pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP) is inversely associated with inflammatory biomarkers. We observed that PLP was inversely associated with C-reactive protein (CRP) (r -0·33, Plinear < 0·0001), serum amyloid A (SAA) (r -0·23, Plinear = 0·003), IL-6 (r -0·39, Plinear < 0·0001), IL-8 (r -0·20, Plinear = 0·02) and TNFα (r -0·12, Plinear = 0·045). Similar findings were observed for 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate and CRP (r -0·14), SAA (r -0·14) and TNFα (r -0·15) among CRC patients. Folate catabolite acetyl-para-aminobenzoylglutamic acid (pABG) was positively correlated with IL-6 (r 0·27, Plinear < 0·0001), and pABG was positively correlated with IL-8 (r 0·21, Plinear < 0·0001), indicating higher folate utilisation during inflammation. Our data support the hypothesis of inverse associations between PLP and inflammatory biomarkers among CRC patients. A better understanding of the role and inter-relation of PLP and other one-carbon metabolites with inflammatory processes among colorectal carcinogenesis and prognosis could identify targets for future dietary guidance for CRC patients.",

        "Abstract": "Chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH), a component of sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome, is suggested to cause damage to lung tissue, and the role of glutamate is not well studied. We used a chronic long-term intermittent hypobaric hypoxia (CLTIHH) model of rats to find out if such procedure causes lung injury and the potential effect of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) by using receptor antagonist MK-801 (dizocilpine). Thirty-two rats were placed into four groups; a control and three CLTIHH groups where rats were placed into a low-pressure chamber set to 430 mmHg for 5 h/day, 5 days/week, for 5 weeks. Only one group received MK-801 (0.3 mg/kg, ip) daily. We evaluated tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, and nuclear factor (NF)-kB for the inflammatory process, superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), total antioxidant status (TAS), and total oxidant status (TOS) for oxidative stress, and caspase-9 levels. Blood plasma, bronchoalveolar fluid (BALF), and lung tissue extracts were evaluated. Both oxidant and inflammatory parameters were significantly increased in all the mediums of the CLTIHH groups except the group that received MK-801. Significant evidence was collected on MK-801 alleviating the effect of CLTIHH. Histological evaluations revealed lung damage and fibrotic changes in the CLTIHH groups. It was first shown that the CLTIHH procedure caused chronic lung injury, and that inflammation and oxidant stress were influential in the formation of lung injury. Secondly, NMDAR antagonist MK-801 effectively inhibited the development of lung injury and fibrosis.",

        "Abstract": "B vitamins involved in one-carbon metabolism have been implicated in the development of inflammation- and angiogenesis-related chronic diseases, such as colorectal cancer (CRC). Yet, the role of one-carbon metabolism in inflammation and angiogenesis among CRC patients remains unclear. The objective of this study was to investigate associations of components of one-carbon metabolism with inflammation and angiogenesis biomarkers among newly diagnosed CRC patients (n 238) in the prospective ColoCare Study, Heidelberg. We cross-sectionally analysed associations between twelve B vitamins and one-carbon metabolites and ten inflammation and angiogenesis biomarkers from pre-surgery serum samples using multivariable linear regression models. We further explored associations among novel biomarkers in these pathways with Spearman partial correlation analyses. We hypothesised that pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP) is inversely associated with inflammatory biomarkers. We observed that PLP was inversely associated with C-reactive protein (CRP) (r -0·33, Plinear < 0·0001), serum amyloid A (SAA) (r -0·23, Plinear = 0·003), IL-6 (r -0·39, Plinear < 0·0001), IL-8 (r -0·20, Plinear = 0·02) and TNFα (r -0·12, Plinear = 0·045). Similar findings were observed for 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate and CRP (r -0·14), SAA (r -0·14) and TNFα (r -0·15) among CRC patients. Folate catabolite acetyl-para-aminobenzoylglutamic acid (pABG) was positively correlated with IL-6 (r 0·27, Plinear < 0·0001), and pABG was positively correlated with IL-8 (r 0·21, Plinear < 0·0001), indicating higher folate utilisation during inflammation. Our data support the hypothesis of inverse associations between PLP and inflammatory biomarkers among CRC patients. A better understanding of the role and inter-relation of PLP and other one-carbon metabolites with inflammatory processes among colorectal carcinogenesis and prognosis could identify targets for future dietary guidance for CRC patients.",
