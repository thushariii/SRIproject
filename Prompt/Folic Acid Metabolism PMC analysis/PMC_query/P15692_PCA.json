        "Abstract": "Studies of the interplay between metabolism and immunity, known as immunometabolism, is steadily transforming immunological research into new understandings of how environmental cues like diet are affecting innate and adaptive immune responses. The aim of this study was to explore antiviral transcriptomic responses under various levels of polyunsaturated fatty acid. Atlantic salmon kidney cells (ASK cell line) were incubated for one week in different levels of the unsaturated n-3 eicosapentaneoic acid (EPA) resulting in cellular levels ranging from 2-20% of total fatty acid. These cells were then stimulated with the viral mimic and interferon inducer poly I:C (30 ug/ml) for 24 hours before total RNA was isolated and sequenced for transcriptomic analyses. Up to 200 uM EPA had no detrimental effects on cell viability and induced very few transcriptional changes in these cells. However, in combination with poly I:C, our results shows that the level of EPA in the cellular membranes exert profound dose dependent effects of the transcriptional profiles induced by this treatment. Metabolic pathways like autophagy, apelin and VEGF signaling were attenuated by EPA whereas transcripts related to fatty acid metabolism, ferroptosis and the PPAR signaling pathways were upregulated. These results suggests that innate antiviral responses are heavily influenced by the fatty acid profile of salmonid cells and constitute another example of the strong linkage between general metabolic pathways and inflammatory responses.",

        "Abstract": "VEGF-A is a key cytokine in tumor angiogenesis and a major therapeutic target for cancer. VEGF165 is the predominant isoform of VEGF-A, and it is the most potent angiogenesis stimulant. VEGFR2/KDR domains 2 and 3 (D2D3) bind to the N-terminal domain (NTD, residues 1-110) of VEGF165. Since removal of the heparin-binding domain (HBD, residues 111-165) markedly reduced the mitogenic activity of the growth factor, it has been proposed that the HBD plays a critical role in the mitogenicity of VEGF165. Here, we report that αvβ3 specifically bound to the isolated VEGF165 HBD but not to VEGF165 NTD. Based on docking simulation and mutagenesis, we identified several critical amino acid residues within the VEGF165 HBD required for αvβ3 binding, i.e., Arg123, Arg124, Lys125, Lys140, Arg145, and Arg149. We discovered that VEGF165 HBD binds to the KDR domain 1 (D1) and identified that Arg123 and Arg124 are critical for KDR D1 binding by mutagenesis, indicating that the KDR D1-binding and αvβ3-binding sites overlap in the HBD. Full-length VEGF165 mutant (R123A/R124A/K125A/K140A/R145A/R149A) defective in αvβ3 and KDR D1 binding failed to induce ERK1/2 phosphorylation, integrin β3 phosphorylation, and KDR phosphorylation and did not support proliferation of endothelial cells, although the mutation did not affect the KDR D2D3 interaction with VEGF165. Since β3-knockout mice are known to show enhanced VEGF165 signaling, we propose that the binding of KDR D1 to the VEGF165 HBD and KDR D2D3 binding to the VEGF165 NTD are critically involved in the potent mitogenicity of VEGF165.

Since β3-knockout mice are known to show enhanced VEGF165 signaling, we propose that the binding of KDR D1 to the VEGF165 HBD and KDR D2D3 binding to the VEGF165 NTD are critically involved in the potent mitogenicity of VEGF165. We propose that binding competition between KDR and αvβ3 to the VEGF165 HBD endows integrin αvβ3 with regulatory properties to act as a negative regulator of VEGF165 signaling.",
