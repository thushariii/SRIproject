Genes and gene products associated with teratospermia may serve as targeted biomarkers that help understand the underlying mechanisms of male infertility; however, systematic information on the subject remains to be elucidated.

These genes were functionally associated with the reproduction process. Gene products corresponding to heat shock protein family A (Hsp70) member 4 like (HSPA4L) and phosphoglycerate kinase 2 were characterized at the cellular level in human testes and ejaculated spermatozoa. HSPA4L expression in sperm was revealed to be associated with sperm quality. The present study provided a novel insight into the understanding of sperm quality, and a potential method for the diagnosis and assessment of sperm quality in the event of male infertility.",

        "Abstract": "1. The synthesis of nitrite and citrulline from L-arginine by immune-stimulated rat alveolar macrophages and the modulation of this synthesis were studied. 2,4-Diamino-6-hydroxypyrimidine (DAHP), 6R-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-L-biopterin (BH4) and L-sepiapterin were potent inhibitors of the recombinant interferon-gamma induced production of nitrogen oxides in intact cultured cells with I50 values for BH4 and L-sepiapterin of approximately 10 microM. They were equally effective in inhibiting the induced production of citrulline. This inhibitory effect was concentration-dependent for all three modulators investigated. 2. The inhibitory effects were not dependent on incubation times of either 24 or 48 h, on the immune-stimulus used (lipopolysaccharide, interferon-gamma), or whether these stimuli were added during or after the induction period. 3. Pterin-6-carboxylic acid (PCA), which cannot be converted into BH4, and methotrexate (MTX), which inhibits dihydrofolatereductase but not de novo biosynthesis of BH4, did not change the production of nitrite. 4. The data indicate that DAHP, an inhibitor of the de novo biosynthesis of the co-factor BH4, blocks the nitric oxide synthase activity in intact cells. Since the pterins BH4 and L-sepiapterin blocked the L-arginine dependent production of nitrite and citrulline, the activity of nitric oxide synthase in phagocytic cells may be regulated by metabolic endproducts of the de novo biosynthesis of BH4.",

        "Abstract": "Rice seeds of different varieties exhibited distinct metabolic profiles in our study. We analyzed the metabolites in seeds of six rice varieties (CH, HM, NX, YX, HY, and MX) using non-targeted GC-MS. Our findings revealed that amino acids, sugars, and organic acids were predominant in all varieties, with significant differences observed in CH compared to the others. Specifically phenylalanine and glycine content differed notably in NX and YX, respectively. Additionally, 1,5-anhydroglucitol content in NX, and glutamate, aspartate, and lactulose in NX, YX, HM, HY, and MX were up-regulated. Due to the biological functions of these amino acids and sugars, these indicated that compared to CH, rice of NX were more conducive to metabolism of carbohydrate and fat, and healthy growth maintenance in the human body, but mightThese variations suggest that NX rice may be more beneficial for carbohydrate and fat metabolism and overall health maintenance compared to CH. However, it may not be suitable for diabetic patients. YX rice may not be an ideal glycine supplement, rice ofwhile HM, HY, and MX rice could serve as potential lactulose sources. Furthermore, NX and YX rice exhibited higher levels of main storage proteins compared to CH. This study offers valuable insights into the metabolic differences among various rice varieties.",
