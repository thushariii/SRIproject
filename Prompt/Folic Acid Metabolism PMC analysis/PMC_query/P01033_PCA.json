Secreted human fibroblast collagenase inhibitor was purified and subjected to automated Edman degradation. The secreted protein consists of 184 amino acid residues; it contains two sites of N-linked oligosaccharide linkage and six disulfide bonds. Synthetic oligonucleotide probes based on selected amino acid sequences of the inhibitor were used to screen a lambda gt10 cDNA library from a human fibroblast line. Two overlapping cDNA clones were characterized to determine the complete coding and noncoding sequences of the specific mRNA. The amino acid sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence agrees with that determined by protein sequencing. One clone appears to contain the complete 5' end and, in addition, the cDNA sequence predicts a 23-amino acid leader peptide. The other clone represents the 3' end of the mature message and includes a short poly(A)+ tract. This 3' sequence is remarkably similar to a reported cDNA encoding part of the protein derived from mouse fibroblast poly(A)+ RNA. However, this inhibitor has no substantial homology with previously sequenced protease inhibitors.",

In order to determine the mechanism of activation of gene transcription by TPA, DNA sequences whose transcription is modulated in cells undergoing a mitogenic response to TPA were isolated by differential screening of a cDNA library from TPA-treated cells. TPA-S1 corresponds to an mRNA species whose abundance is increased within 1 hr of exposure of quiescent C3H 10T1/2 mouse embryo fibroblasts. TPA-R1 corresponds to an mRNA species whose abundance is decreased in TPA-treated cells. The induction of TPA-S1 is blocked by actinomycin D and is specific for phorbol esters with tumor-promoting activity. The transcription of this sequence is not induced by cycloheximide, nor is there an enhancement of the TPA response. Several lines of evidence demonstrate that PKC activation plays a critical role in the regulation of TPA-S1 expression. The nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequence of TPA-S1 exhibits homology with sequences representing a peptide with erythroid-potentiating activity, a metalloproteinase inhibitor protein, and a murine protein with beta-interferon-like activity. The role of TPA-S1 in tumor promotion is suggested by the expression of this sequence in mouse skin carcinomas induced by dimethyl-benzanthracene-TPA treatment, but not in papillomas or in control tissue.

The induction of TPA-S1 was blocked by actinomycin D but was not affected by cycloheximide, and it was specific for phorbol esters with tumor-promoting activity. The role of protein kinase C in the induction of TPA-S1 is supported by the following lines of evidence. (i) Agents that activated protein kinase C (TPA, platelet-derived growth factor, and diacylglycerol) also increased TPA-S1 mRNA levels. (ii) A potent PKC inhibitor blocked the induction of TPA-S1. (iii) Down-regulation of PKC activity, by treatment of cells with TPA for 24 h, resulted in a loss of responsiveness to TPA-S1 induction by subsequent TPA treatment. DNA sequence analysis of TPA-S1 predicts a cysteine-rich, secreted protein with a molecular weight of 22.6 X 10(3) that exhibits homology with sequences representing a protein with human erythroid-potentiating activity and protease inhibitory activity.",

        "Abstract": "Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder is the most common cause of mental disabilities in the western world. It has been quite established that acute alcohol exposure can dramatically affect astrocyte function. Because the effects of early alcohol exposure on cell physiology can persist into adulthood, we tested the hypothesis that ethanol exposure in ferrets during a period equivalent to the last months of human gestation leads to persistent changes in astrocyte secretome in vitro. Animals were treated with ethanol (3.5 g/kg) or saline between postnatal day (P)10-30. At P31, astrocyte cultures were made and cells were submitted to stable isotope labeling by amino acids. Twenty-four hour conditioned media of cells obtained from ethanol- or saline-treated animals (ET-CM or SAL-CM) were collected and analyzed by quantitative mass spectrometry in tandem with liquid chromatography. Here, we show that 65 out of 280 quantifiable proteins displayed significant differences comparing ET-CM to SAL-CM. Among the 59 proteins that were found to be reduced in ET-CM we observed components of the extracellular matrix such as laminin subunits α2, α4, β1, β2, and γ1 and the proteoglycans biglycan, heparan sulfate proteoglycan 2, and lumican. Proteins with trophic function such as insulin-like growth factor binding protein 4, pigment epithelium-derived factor, and clusterin as well as proteins involved on modulation of proteolysis such as metalloproteinase inhibitor 1 and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 were also reduced. In contrast, pro-synaptogeneic proteins like thrombospondin-1, hevin as well as the modulator of extracelular matrix expression, angiotensinogen, were found increased in ET-CM. The analysis of interactome maps through ingenuity pathway analysis demonstrated that the amyloid beta A4 protein precursor, which was found reduced in ET-CM, was previously shown to interact with ten other proteins that exhibited significant changes in the ET-CM. Taken together our results strongly suggest that early exposure to teratogens such as alcohol may lead to an enduring change in astrocyte secretome. Despite efforts in prevention, fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are a major cause of mental disabilities. Here, we show that developmental exposure to alcohol lead to a persistent change in the pattern of proteins secreted (secretome) by astrocytes. This study is also the first mass spectrometry-based assessment of the astrocyte secretome in a gyrencephalic animal. Cover Image for this issue: doi: 10.1111/jnc.13320.",

        "Abstract": "Quantitative analysis of protein biomarkers in plasma is typically done by ELISA, but this method is limited by the availability of high-quality antibodies. An alternative approach is protein immunoprecipitation combined with multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry (IP-MRM). We compared IP-MRM to ELISA for the analysis of six colon cancer biomarker candidates (metalloproteinase inhibitor 1 (TIMP1), cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), thrombospondin-2 (THBS2), endoglin (ENG), mesothelin (MSLN) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9)) in plasma from colon cancer patients and noncancer controls. Proteins were analyzed by multiplex immunoprecipitation from plasma with the ELISA capture antibodies, further purified by SDS-PAGE, digested and analyzed by stable isotope dilution MRM. IP-MRM provided linear responses (r = 0.978-0.995) between 10 and 640 ng/mL for the target proteins spiked into a \"mock plasma\" matrix consisting of 60 mg/mL bovine serum albumin. Measurement variation (coefficient of variation at the limit of detection) for IP-MRM assays ranged from 2.3 to 19%, which was similar to variation for ELISAs of the same samples. IP-MRM and ELISA measurements for all target proteins except ENG were highly correlated (r = 0.67-0.97). IP-MRM with high-quality capture antibodies thus provides an effective alternative method to ELISA for protein quantitation in biological fluids.",

Among the 59 proteins that were found to be reduced in ET-CM we observed components of the extracellular matrix such as laminin subunits α2, α4, β1, β2, and γ1 and the proteoglycans biglycan, heparan sulfate proteoglycan 2, and lumican. Proteins with trophic function such as insulin-like growth factor binding protein 4, pigment epithelium-derived factor, and clusterin as well as proteins involved on modulation of proteolysis such as metalloproteinase inhibitor 1 and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 were also reduced. In contrast, pro-synaptogeneic proteins like thrombospondin-1, hevin as well as the modulator of extracelular matrix expression, angiotensinogen, were found increased in ET-CM. The analysis of interactome maps through ingenuity pathway analysis demonstrated that the amyloid beta A4 protein precursor, which was found reduced in ET-CM, was previously shown to interact with ten other proteins that exhibited significant changes in the ET-CM. Taken together our results strongly suggest that early exposure to teratogens such as alcohol may lead to an enduring change in astrocyte secretome. Despite efforts in prevention, fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are a major cause of mental disabilities. Here, we show that developmental exposure to alcohol lead to a persistent change in the pattern of proteins secreted (secretome) by astrocytes. This study is also the first mass spectrometry-based assessment of the astrocyte secretome in a gyrencephalic animal. Cover Image for this issue: doi: 10.1111/jnc.13320.",

        "Abstract": "Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder is the most common cause of mental disabilities in the western world. It has been quite established that acute alcohol exposure can dramatically affect astrocyte function. Because the effects of early alcohol exposure on cell physiology can persist into adulthood, we tested the hypothesis that ethanol exposure in ferrets during a period equivalent to the last months of human gestation leads to persistent changes in astrocyte secretome in vitro. Animals were treated with ethanol (3.5 g/kg) or saline between postnatal day (P)10-30. At P31, astrocyte cultures were made and cells were submitted to stable isotope labeling by amino acids. Twenty-four hour conditioned media of cells obtained from ethanol- or saline-treated animals (ET-CM or SAL-CM) were collected and analyzed by quantitative mass spectrometry in tandem with liquid chromatography. Here, we show that 65 out of 280 quantifiable proteins displayed significant differences comparing ET-CM to SAL-CM. Among the 59 proteins that were found to be reduced in ET-CM we observed components of the extracellular matrix such as laminin subunits α2, α4, β1, β2, and γ1 and the proteoglycans biglycan, heparan sulfate proteoglycan 2, and lumican. Proteins with trophic function such as insulin-like growth factor binding protein 4, pigment epithelium-derived factor, and clusterin as well as proteins involved on modulation of proteolysis such as metalloproteinase inhibitor 1 and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 were also reduced. In contrast, pro-synaptogeneic proteins like thrombospondin-1, hevin as well as the modulator of extracelular matrix expression, angiotensinogen, were found increased in ET-CM.
