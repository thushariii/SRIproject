        "Abstract": "The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) gelatinase A (MMP-2) and gelatinase B (MMP-9) are mediators of brain injury in multiple sclerosis (MS) and valuable biomarkers of disease activity. We applied bidimensional zymography (2-DZ) as an extension of classic monodimensional zymography (1-DZ) to analyse the complete pattern of isoforms and post-translational modifications of both MMP-9 and MMP-2 present in the sera of MS patients. The enzymes were separated on the basis of their isoelectric points (pI) and apparent molecular weights (Mw) and identified both by comparison with standard enzyme preparations and by Western blot analysis. Two MMP-2 isoforms, and at least three different isoforms and two different states of organization of MMP-9 (the multimeric MMP-9 and the N-GAL-MMP-9 complex) were observed. In addition, 2-DZ revealed for the first time that all MMP-9 and MMP-2 isoforms actually exist in the form of charge variants: four or five variants in the NGAL complex, more charge variants in the case of MMP-9; and five to seven charge variants for MMP-2. Charge variants were also observed in recombinant enzymes and, after concentration, also in sera from healthy individuals. Sialylation (MMP-9) and phosphorylation (MMP-2) contributed to molecular heterogeneity. The detection of charge variants of MMP-9 and MMP-2 in MS serum samples illustrates the power of 2-DZ and demonstrates that in previous studies MMP mixtures, rather than single molecules, were analysed. These observations open perspectives for better diagnosis and prognosis of many diseases and need to be critically interpreted when applying other methods for MS and other diseases.",

        "Abstract": "The current study aimed to assess the possible endocrine disruptor effects on rat mammary tissue and reproductive organs during pregnancy and lactation when exposed to low doses of glyphosate and its combination with 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and dicamba. The study involved the exposure of pregnant Wistar rats to various regulatory-relevant doses of glyphosate, ranging from gestational day 6 until fine of the lactation period. Glyphosate doses corresponded to the European Union's glyphosate-acceptable daily intake (ADI; 0.5mg/kg bw/day) and no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL; 50mg/kg bw/day). The dose of the mixture of glyphosate, dicamba, and 2,4-D was at the European Union ADI for each herbicide namely 0.5, 0.002, and 0.3mg/kg bw/day, respectively. In the animals exposed to glyphosate NOAEL serum estradiol levels were increased compared to untreated animals, along with an upregulation of TNF-?, MMP-2, and MMP-9 as measured in mammary gland homogenates compared to non-treated animals. Moreover, in this group, a focally acute inflammatory infiltrate was observed in the mammary gland. Our study showed that short-term exposure to glyphosate at doses that are set as safe by regulators and thus without risk corroborated with a particular physiological state as gestation and lactation, can give rise to inflammatory changes in breast tissue in rats. These findings support the need for further evaluation of glyphosate and mixtures of glyphosate with other pesticides for public health protection, especially for those categories vulnerable to the potential endocrine disruptor properties of these pesticides such as pregnant women, newborns, and children.",

        "Abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most lethal and common malignant primary brain tumor in adults. An important feature that supports GBM aggressiveness is the unique composition of its extracellular matrix (ECM). Particularly, fibronectin plays an important role in cancer cell adhesion, differentiation, proliferation, and chemoresistance. Thus, herein, a hydrogel with mechanical properties compatible with the brain and the ability to disrupt the dynamic and reciprocal interaction between fibronectin and tumor cells was produced. High-molecular-weight hyaluronic acid (HMW-HA) functionalized with the inhibitory fibronectin peptide Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (RGDS) was used to produce the polymeric matrix. Liposomes encapsulating doxorubicin (DOX) were also included in the hydrogel to kill GBM cells. The resulting hydrogel containing liposomes with therapeutic DOX concentrations presented rheological properties like a healthy brain. In vitro assays demonstrated that unmodified HMW-HA hydrogels only caused GBM cell killing after DOX incorporation. Conversely, RGDS-functionalized hydrogels displayed per se cytotoxicity. As GBM cells produce several proteolytic enzymes capable of disrupting the peptide-HA bond, we selected MMP-2 to illustrate this phenomenon. Therefore, RGDS internalization can induce GBM cell apoptosis. Importantly, RGDS-functionalized hydrogel incorporating DOX efficiently damaged GBM cells without affecting astrocyte viability, proving its safety. Overall, the results demonstrate the potential of the RGDS-functionalized hydrogel to develop safe and effective GBM treatments.",

        "Abstract": "Autophagy contributes to the pathogenesis of cancer, whereas toll-like receptors (TLRs) also play an important role in cancer development and immune escape. However, little is known about the potential interaction between TLR signaling and autophagy in cancer cells. Here we show that autophagy induced by TLR4 or TLR3 activation enhances various cytokine productions through promoting TRAF6 (TNF receptor-associated factor 6, E3 ubiquitin protein ligase) ubiquitination and thus facilitates migration and invasion of lung cancer cells. Stimulation of TLR4 and TLR3 with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid [poly(I:C)] respectively triggered autophagy in lung cancer cells. This was mediated by the adaptor protein, toll-like receptor adaptor molecule 1 (TICAM1/TRIF), and was required for TLR4- and TLR3-induced increases in the production of IL6, CCL2/MCP-1 [chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2], CCL20/MIP-3α [chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 20], VEGFA (vascular endothelial growth factor A), and MMP2 [matrix metallopeptidase 2 (gelatinase A, 72 kDa gelatinase, 72 kDa type IV collagenase)]. These cytokines appeared to be necessary for enhanced migration and invasion of lung cancer cells upon TLR activation. Remarkably, inhibition of autophagy by chemical or genetic approaches blocked TLR4- or TLR3-induced Lys63 (K63)-linked ubiquitination of TRAF6 that was essential for activation of MAPK and NFKB (nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells) pathways, both of which were involved in the increased production of the cytokines. Collectively, these results identify induction of autophagy by TLR4 and TLR3 as an important mechanism that drives lung cancer progression, and indicate that inhibition of autophagy may be a useful strategy in the treatment of lung cancer.",

These cytokines appeared to be necessary for enhanced migration and invasion of lung cancer cells upon TLR activation. Remarkably, inhibition of autophagy by chemical or genetic approaches blocked TLR4- or TLR3-induced Lys63 (K63)-linked ubiquitination of TRAF6 that was essential for activation of MAPK and NFKB (nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells) pathways, both of which were involved in the increased production of the cytokines. Collectively, these results identify induction of autophagy by TLR4 and TLR3 as an important mechanism that drives lung cancer progression, and indicate that inhibition of autophagy may be a useful strategy in the treatment of lung cancer.",
