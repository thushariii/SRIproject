Mechanistic physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models recapitulate anatomic compartments to predict elimination from estimated perfusion, filtration, secretion, and re-absorption, but clinical applications are limited by a lack of empiric individual-level measurements of these functions. We adapted and validated a PBPK model to predict drug clearance from individual biomarker-based estimates of kidney perfusion and secretory clearance. We estimated organic anion transporter-mediated secretion via kynurenic acid clearance and kidney blood flow (KBF) via isovalerylglycine clearance in human participants, incorporating these measurements with GFR into the model to predict kidney drug clearance. We compared measured and model-predicted clearances of administered tenofovir and oseltamivir, which are cleared by both filtration and secretion.

The aim of this study is to investigate LC proliferation regulated by metabolite-mediated IGF1R lactylation. IGF1R was highly expressed in LC tissues and cells, and the effects of IGF1R on protein stability were inhibited by Lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) inhibition. Moreover, the tightness of IGF1R binding to IGF1 was also enhanced by exogenous lactic acid but suppressed by LDHA silencing, while cell viability and proliferation were promoted by over-expression of IGF1R. Exogenous lactic acid further exacerbated the effects of the IGF1R gene, while LDHA knocking down reduced the IGF1R-induced malignant behaviors. The IGF1R and exogenous lactic acid were also found to increase extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) and decrease oxygen consumption rate to regulate glycolysis, which was inhibited by LDHA deficiency in LC cells. The study concluded that IGF1R-mediated aggressive behaviors of LC cells were associated with higher levels of IGF1R lactylation. Moreover, lactic acid can improve the protein stability of the IGF1R oncogene, thus promoting glycolysis and generating lactic acid, forming a closed loop.

        "Abstract": "Graves' ophthalmopathy (GO) is an extrathyroidal manifestation of Graves' disease, Orbital fibroblasts (OFs) are recognized as key players in GO pathogenesis, involved in orbital inflammation, tissue remodeling, and fibrosis. This study offers a primary exploration of cell behavior and characteristics on OFs from GO (GO-OFs), and compared to OFs from healthy control (HC-OFs). Results reveal that GO-OFs exhibit delayed migration from tissue fragments, while no significant difference in cell proliferation is observed between GO-OFs and HC-OFs. Aberrant expression pattern of surface proteins Thy-1, TSHR, and IGF-1R suggests shared autoantigens and pathways between GO and GD, contributing to inflammation and fibrosis. Investigations into cytokine responses unveil elevated secretion of hyaluronic acid (HA) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in GO-OFs, emphasizing their role in tissue remodeling. These findings deepen our understanding of OFs in GO pathogenesis, offering potential therapeutic avenues.",

        "Abstract": "Circular RNAs (circRNAs) play a critical regulatory role in degenerative diseases; however, their functions and therapeutic applications in intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) have not been explored. Here, we identified that a novel circATXN1 highly accumulates in aging nucleus pulposus cells (NPCs) accountable for IVDD. CircATXN1 accelerates cellular senescence, disrupts extracellular matrix organization, and inhibits mitochondrial respiration. Mechanistically, circATXN1, regulated by heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2B1-mediated splicing circularization, promotes progerin translocation from the cell nucleus to the cytoplasm and inhibits the expression of insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R). To demonstrate the therapeutic potential of circATXN1, siRNA targeting the backsplice junction of circATNX1 was screened and delivered by tetrahedral framework nucleic acids (tFNAs) due to their unique compositional and tetrahedral structural features. Our siRNA delivery system demonstrates superior abilities to transfect aging cells, clear intracellular ROS, and enhanced biological safety. Using siRNA-tFNAs to silence circATXN1, aging NPCs exhibit reduced mislocalization of progerin in the cytoplasm and up-regulation of IGF-1R, thereby demonstrating a rejuvenated cellular phenotype and improved mitochondrial function. In vivo, administering an aging cell-adapted siRNA nucleic acid framework delivery system to progerin pathologically expressed premature aging mice (zmpste24",
