        "Abstract": "Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death worldwide. Heart failure is a cardiovascular disease with high prevalence, morbidity, and mortality. Several natural compounds have been studied for attenuating pathological cardiac remodeling. Orange juice has been associated with cardiovascular disease prevention by attenuating oxidative stress. However, most studies have evaluated isolated phytochemicals rather than whole orange juice and usually under pathological conditions. In this study, we evaluated plasma metabolomics in healthy rats receiving Pera or Moro orange juice to identify possible metabolic pathways and their effects on the heart.",

        "Abstract": "This study aimed to reveal the clinical usefulness of urinary biomarkers for the early prediction of AKI onset after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) (n = 173). In this study, 22 (12.7%) patients had AKI, of which 21 had mild AKI and 1 had moderate AKI. Higher levels of urinary liver-type fatty acid binding protein (L-FABP), [tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2] × [insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7], clusterin and urinary albumin before, after and 4 h after TAVI were associated with AKI onset. However, the time point of higher urinary N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase levels related to AKI onset was only before TAVI. No significant differences were found in the area under the receiver-operator characteristic curves (AUC) for predicting AKI onset between urinary biomarkers before TAVI. After TAVI, the AUC (0.81) of urinary albumin was significantly higher than those of any other urinary biomarkers. The sensitivity (0.86) in urinary albumin after TAVI and specificity (0.98) in urinary L-FABP before TAVI were the highest among urinary biomarkers. In conclusion, urinary biomarkers may be clinically useful for early differentiation of patients with a higher or lower risk for AKI onset or early prediction of post-TAVI onset of AKI.",
