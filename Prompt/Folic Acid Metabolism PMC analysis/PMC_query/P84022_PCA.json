        "Abstract": "Hyperuricemia is an independent risk factor for chronic kidney disease and contributes to renal fibrosis. This study aims to investigate the effect of Src family kinase (SFK) inhibition on the development of hyperuricemic nephropathy (HN) and the mechanisms involved. In a rat model of HN, feeding rats a mixture of adenine and potassium oxonate increased Src phosphorylation, severe glomerular sclerosis, and renal interstitial fibrosis, accompanied by renal dysfunction and increased urine microalbumin excretion. Administration of PP1, a highly selective SFK inhibitor, prevented renal dysfunction, reduced urine microalbumin, and inhibited activation of renal interstitial fibroblasts and expression of extracellular proteins. PP1 treatment also inhibited hyperuricemia-induced activation of the TGF-β1/Smad3, STAT3, ERK1/2, and NF-κB signaling pathways and expression of multiple profibrogenic cytokines/chemokines in the kidney. Furthermore, PP1 treatment significantly reduced serum uric acid levels and xanthine oxidase activity. Thus, blocking Src can attenuate development of HN via a mechanism associated with the suppression of TGF-β1 signaling, inflammation, and uric acid production. The results suggest that Src inhibition might be a promising therapeutic strategy for HN.",

        "Abstract": "Malignant tumors often escape anticancer immune surveillance by suppressing the cytotoxic functions of T lymphocytes. While many of these immune evasion networks include checkpoint proteins, small molecular weight compounds, such as the amino acid L-kynurenine (LKU), could also substantially contribute to the suppression of anti-cancer immunity. However, the biochemical mechanisms underlying the suppressive effects of LKU on T-cells remain unclear. Here, we report for the first time that LKU suppresses T cell function as an aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) ligand. The presence of LKU in T cells is associated with AhR activation, which results in competition between AhR and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α) for the AhR nuclear translocator, ARNT, leading to T cell exhaustion. The expression of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1, the enzyme that leads to LKU generation) is induced by the TGF-β-Smad-3 pathway. We also show that IDO-negative cancers utilize an alternative route for LKU production",

        "Abstract": "We investigated the regulation of the activin/nodal-inducible distal element (DE) of the Xenopus goosecoid (gsc) promoter. On the basis of its interaction with the DE, we isolated a Xenopus homolog of the human Williams-Beuren syndrome critical region 11 (XWBSCR11), and further, show that it interacts with pathway-specific Smad2 and Smad3 in a ligand-dependent manner. Interestingly, we also find that XWBSCR11 functions cooperatively with FoxH1 (Fast-1) to stimulate DE-dependent transcription. We propose a mechanism in which FoxH1 functions together with Smads as a cofactor for the recruitment of transcription factors like XWBSCR11 in the process of activin/nodal-mediated gsc-specific induction. This mechanism provides considerable opportunities for modulation of transcription across a variety of activin/nodal-inducible genes, increasing diversity in promoter selection, thus leading to the differential induction of activin/nodal target genes.",

        "Abstract": "Previous studies suggest that the reduction of SMAD3 (mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 3) has a great impact on tumor development, but its exact pathological function remains unclear. In this study, we found that the protein level of SMAD3 was greatly reduced in human-grade IV glioblastoma tissues, in which LAMP2A (lysosome-associated membrane protein type 2A) was significantly up-regulated. LAMP2A is a key rate-limiting protein of chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), a lysosome pathway of protein degradation that is activated in glioma. We carefully analyzed the amino-acid sequence of SMAD3 and found that it contained a pentapeptide motif biochemically related to KFERQ, which has been proposed to be a targeting sequence for CMA. In vitro, we confirmed that SMAD3 was degraded in either serum-free or KFERQ motif deleted condition, which was regulated by LAMP2A and interacted with HSC70 (heat shock cognate 71 kDa protein). Using isolated lysosomes, amino-acid residues 75 and 128 of SMAD3 were found to be of importance for this process, which affected the CMA pathway in which SMAD3 was involved. Similarly, down-regulating SMAD3 or up-regulating LAMP2A in cultured glioma cells enhanced their proliferation and invasion. Taken together, these results suggest that excessive activation of CMA regulates glioma cell growth by promoting the degradation of SMAD3. Therefore, targeting the SMAD3-LAMP2A-mediated CMA-lysosome pathway may be a promising approach in anti-cancer therapy.",

        "Abstract": "The target and mechanism of ellagic acid (EA) against rotavirus (RV) were investigated by network pharmacology, computational biology, and surface plasmon resonance verification. The target of EA was obtained from 11 databases such as HIT and TCMSP, and RV-related targets were obtained from the Gene Cards database. The relevant targets were imported into the Venny platform to draw a Venn diagram, and their intersections were visualized. The protein-protein interaction networks (PPI) were constructed using STRING, DAVID database, and Cytoscape software, and key targets were screened. The target was enriched by Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway, and the 'EA anti-RV target-pathway network' was constructed. Schrodinger Maestro 13.5 software was used for molecular docking to determine the binding free energy and binding mode of ellagic acid and target protein. The Desmond program was used for molecular dynamics simulation. Saturation mutagenesis analysis was performed using Schrodinger's Maestro 13.5 software. Finally, the affinity between ellagic acid and TLR4 protein was investigated by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments. The results of network pharmacological analysis showed that there were 35 intersection proteins, among which Interleukin-1β (IL-1β), Albumin (ALB), Nuclear factor kappa-B1 (NF-κB1), Toll-Like Receptor 4 (TLR4), Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), Tumor protein p53 (TP53), Recombinant SMAD family member 3 (SAMD3), Epidermal growth factor (EGF) and Interleukin-4 (IL-4) were potential core targets of EA anti-RV. The GO analysis consists of biological processes (BP), cellular components (CC), and molecular functions (MF). The KEGG pathways with the highest gene count were mainly related to enteritis, cancer, IL-17 signaling pathway, and MAPK signaling pathway. Based on the crystal structure of key targets, the complex structure models of TP53-EA, TLR4-EA, TNF-EA, IL-1β-EA, ALB-EA, NF-κB1-EA, SAMD3-EA, EGF-EA, and IL-4-EA were constructed by molecular docking (XP mode of flexible docking). The MMGBS analysis and molecular dynamics simulation were also studied. The Δaffinity of TP53 was highest in 220 (CYS → TRP), 220 (CYS → TYR), and 220 (CYS → PHE), respectively. The Δaffinity of TLR4 was highest in 136 (THR → TYR), 136 (THR → PHE), and 136 (THR → TRP). The Δaffinity of TNF-α was highest in 150 (VAL → TRP), 18 (ALA → GLU), and 144 (PHE → GLY). SPR results showed that ellagic acid could bind TLR4 protein specifically. TP53, TLR4, and TNF-α are potential targets for EA to exert anti-RV effects, which may ultimately provide theoretical basis and clues for EA to be used as anti-RV drugs by regulating TLR4/NF-κB related pathways.",
