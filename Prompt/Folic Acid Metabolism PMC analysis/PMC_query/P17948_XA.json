        "Abstract": "Aurora kinase A and B have essential and non-overlapping roles in mitosis, with elevated expression in a subset of human cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In this study, pan-aurora kinase inhibitor (AKI) AMG 900 distinguishes itself as an anti-leukemic agent that is more uniformly potent against a panel of AML cell lines than are isoform-selective AKIs and classic AML drugs. AMG 900 inhibited AML cell growth by inducing polyploidization and/or apoptosis. AMG 900 and aurora-B-selective inhibitor AZD1152-hQPA showed comparable cellular effects on AML lines that do not harbor a",
