        "Abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance in fungal pathogens (both human and plant) is increasing alarmingly, leading to massive economic crises. The existing anti-fungal agents are becoming ineffective, and the situation worsens on a logarithmic scale. Novel antifungals from unique natural sources are highly sought to cope sustainably with the situation. Metabolites from endophytic microbes are the best-fitted alternatives in this case. Endophytes are the untapped sources of 'plants' internal microbial population' and are promising sources of effective bio-therapeutic agents. Fungal endophytes were isolated from Tropaeolum majus and checked for antifungal activity against selected plant and human pathogens. Bioactive metabolites were identified through chromatographic techniques. The mode of action of those metabolites was evaluated through various spectroscopic techniques. The production of antifungal metabolite was optimized also. In particular VOCs (volatile organic compounds) of TML9 were tested in vitro for their anti-phytopathogenic activity. Ethyl acetate (EA) extract of cell-free culture components of Colletotrichum aenigma TML3 exhibited broad-spectrum antifungal activity against four species of Candida and the major constituents reported were 6-pentyl-2H-pyran-2-one, 2-Nonanone, 1 propanol 2-amino. The volatile metabolites, trans-ocimene, geraniol, and 4-terpinyl acetate, produced from Curvularia lunata TML9, inhibited the growth of some selected phyto pathogens. EA extract hampered the biofilm formation, minimised the haemolytic effect, and blocked the transformation of Candida albicans (MTCC 4748) from yeast to hyphal form with a Minimum Fungicidal Concentration (MFC) of 200-600 µg mL",
