        "Abstract": "T lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive haematolymphoid malignancy comprising 15% of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Although its prognosis has improved with intensive chemotherapy, the relapse/refractory disease still carries a dismal prognosis. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop novel therapy for T-ALL. Bortezomib, a 26S proteasome inhibitor, is licensed to treat plasma cell myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma. Due to its favorable side effect profile, it is a novel agent of research interest in the treatment of ALL. Despite an increasing number of clinical trials of bortezomib in T-ALL, its detailed mechanistic study in terms of DNA damage, cell cycle, and mitotic catastrophe remains elusive. Moreover, WEE1, a protein kinase overexpressed in ALL and involved in cell-cycle regulation, has been known to be a novel therapeutic target in many cancers. But the role of bortezomib in modulating WEE1 expression in ALL still remains elusive. In this study, we demonstrate the therapeutic efficacy of bortezomib on T-ALL primary samples and cell lines. Our findings reveal that bortezomib treatment induces DNA damage and downregulates WEE1, leading to G2-M cell-cycle progression with damaged DNA. This abnormal mitotic entry induced by bortezomib leads to mitotic catastrophe in T-ALL. In conclusion, our findings dissect the mechanism of action of bortezomib and provide further insights into the use of bortezomib to treat T-ALL. Our findings suggest the possibility of novel combination therapy using proteasome inhibitors together with DNA-damaging agents in the future, which may fill the research gaps and unmet clinical needs in treating ALL.",

        "Abstract": "Drug synergy allows reduced dosing, side effects and tolerance. Optimization of drug synergy chemotherapy is fundamental in acute lymphocytic leukemia and other cancers. This study aimed to analyze the pharmacodynamic synergy between the anti-metabolite cytarabine and WEE1 inhibitor adavosertib on acute leukemia cell lines CCRF-CEM and Jurkat. In both cell lines analysis of concentration-inhibition curves of adavosertib-cytarabine combinations and synergy matrixes supported mutually synergistic drug interactions. Overall mean ( ± SD) synergy scores were higher in Jurkat than CCRF-CEM: Jurkat, ZIP 22.51 ± 1.1, Bliss 22.49 ± 1.1, HSA 23.44 ± 1.0, Loewe 14.16 ± 1.2; and, CCRF-CEM, ZIP 9.17 ± 1.9, Bliss 8.13 ± 2.1, HSA 11.48 ± 1.9 and Loewe 4.99 ± 1.8. Jurkat also surpassed CCRF-CEM in high-degree synergistic adavosertib-cytarabine interactions with mean across-models synergy values of ∼89.1% ± 2.9 for 63 nM cytarabine-97 nM adavosertib (91.4% inhibition synergy barometer). Combination sensitivity scores scatter plots confirmed combination's synergy efficacy. This combined approach permitted identification and prioritization of 63 nM cytarabine-97 nM adavosertib for multiple endpoints analysis. This combination did not affect PBMC viability, while exhibiting Jurkat selective synergy. Immunoblots also revealed Jurkat selective synergistically increased γH2AX phosphorylation, while CDC2 phosphorylation effects were attributed to adavosertib's WEE1 inhibition. In conclusion, the high synergistic efficacy combination of cytarabine (63 nM) and adavosertib (97 nM) was associated with remarkable alterations in metabolites related to the Krebs cycle in Jurkat. The metabolic pathways and processes are related to gluconeogenesis, amino acids, nucleotides, glutathione, electron transport and Warburg effect. All above relate to cell survival, apoptosis, and cancer progression. Our findings could pave the way for novel biomarkers in treatment, diagnosis, and prognosis of leukemia and other cancers.",

In addition, a peptide antibody generated against amino acids 361-388 of p49WEE1Hu was also used. Unexpectantly, these antibodies recognized a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 95 kDa in HeLa cells, rather than one of 49 kDa. Immunoprecipitates of p95 phosphorylated p34cdc2 on Tyr-15, indicating that p95 is functionally related to p49WEEIHu, and mapping studies demonstrated that p95 is structurally related to p49WEE1Hu. In addition, the substrate specificity of p95 was more similar to that of fission yeast p107wee1 than to that of human p49WEE1. Finally, the kinase activity of p95 toward p34cdc2/cyclin B was severely impaired during mitosis. Taken together, these results indicate that the original WEE1Hu clone isolated in genetic screens encodes only the catalytic domain of human WEE1 and that the authentic human WEE1 protein has an apparent molecular mass of approximately 95 kDa.",

        "Abstract": "In higher eukaryotes, the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are negatively regulated by phosphorylation on threonine 14 (T14) and tyrosine 15 (Y15). In fission yeast, the Wee1 and mitosis inhibitory kinase 1 (Mik1) protein kinases phosphorylate Y15 in Cdc2. WEE1Hu is the only known protein kinase that can carry out this inhibitory phosphorylation on Y15 in higher eukaryotes. In the present study, we examined the endogenous products of WEE1Hu in human cells and found that the original WEE1Hu cDNA lacked 214 amino acids at the N-terminus. The predicted full-length protein has weak, but significant, similarity over its entire length with Mik1. Thus, we suggest that 'WEE1Hu' is a Mik1-related protein rather than a Wee1 homologue. When isolated in immunoprecipitates, the endogenous WEE1Hu phosphorylated several cyclin-associated CDKs on Y15. WEE1Hu activity increased during S and G2 phases in parallel with the level of protein. Its activity decreased at M phase when WEE1Hu became transiently hyperphosphorylated. In addition, a decrease in WEE1Hu protein level was observed at M/G1 phase. Apparently, the hyperphosphorylation and degradation in combination caused inactivation of WEE1Hu at M phase and the following G1 phase. These results suggest that the activity of WEE1Hu is regulated by phosphorylation and proteolytic degradation, and that WEE1Hu plays a role in inhibiting mitosis before M phase by phosphorylating cyclin B1-Cdc2.",

To solve this problem, we reconstituted the M-phase supershift of Xenopus Cdc25C, Myt1, Wee1A, APC3, and Greatwall in Xenopus egg extracts and characterized the supershift-producing phosphorylations. Our results demonstrate that their M-phase supershifts are each due to simultaneous phosphorylation of a considerable portion of S/T/Y residues in a long intrinsically disordered region that is enriched in both S/T residues and S/TP motifs. Although the major mitotic kinases in Xenopus egg extracts, Cdk1, MAPK, Plx1, and RSK2, are able to phosphorylate the five mitotic regulators, they are neither sufficient nor required to produce the M-phase supershift. Accordingly, inhibition of the four major mitotic kinase activities in Xenopus oocytes did not inhibit the M-phase supershift in okadaic acid-induced oocyte maturation.

        "Abstract": "Radiotherapy is one of the most effective and frequently used treatments for a wide range of cancers. In addition to its direct anti-cancer cytotoxic effects, ionising radiation can augment the anti-tumour immune response by triggering pro-inflammatory signals, DNA damage-induced immunogenic cell death and innate immune activation. Anti-tumour innate immunity can result from recruitment and stimulation of dendritic cells (DCs) which leads to tumour-specific adaptive T-cell priming and immunostimulatory cell infiltration. Conversely, radiotherapy can also induce immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory mediators that can confer radioresistance. Targeting the DNA damage response (DDR) concomitantly with radiotherapy is an attractive strategy for overcoming radioresistance, both by enhancing the radiosensitivity of tumour relative to normal tissues, and tipping the scales in favour of an immunostimulatory tumour microenvironment. This two-pronged approach exploits genomic instability to circumvent immune evasion, targeting both hallmarks of cancer. In this review, we describe targetable DDR proteins (PARP (poly[ADP-ribose] polymerase); ATM/ATR (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated and Rad3-related), DNA-PKcs (DNA-dependent protein kinase, catalytic subunit) and Wee1 (Wee1-like protein kinase) and their potential intersections with druggable immunomodulatory signalling pathways, including nucleic acid-sensing mechanisms (Toll-like receptors (TLR); cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) and retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptors), and how these might be exploited to enhance radiation therapy. We summarise current preclinical advances, recent and ongoing clinical trials and the challenges of therapeutic combinations with existing treatments such as immune checkpoint inhibitors.",
