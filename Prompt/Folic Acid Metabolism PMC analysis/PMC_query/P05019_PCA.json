The introduction of solid feed to the rumen is essential for rumen growth and functional development in post-weaning calves. Increasing evidence suggests that solid feed stimulates rumen growth and functional development through butyric acid and other volatile fatty acids (VFAs) produced by microbial fermentation of feed in the rumen and that VFAs stimulate rumen growth and functional development through hormones such as insulin and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) or through direct actions on energy production, chromatin modification, and gene expression.

The goals of our study were to evaluate the metabolomic profile of MM patients to identify those at high risk prior to carfilzomib treatment and to explore the mechanisms of carfilzomib-CVAE to inform potential strategies to protect patients from this cardiotoxicity. Global metabolomic profiling was performed on the baseline and post-baseline plasma samples of 60 MM patients treated with carfilzomib-based therapy, including 31 who experienced CVAE, in a prospective cohort study. Baseline metabolites and post-baseline/baseline metabolite ratios that differ between the CVAE and no-CVAE patients were identified using unadjusted and adjusted methods. A baseline metabolomic risk score was created to stratify patients.

A metabolite risk score was able to stratify patients into three risk groups. The area under the receiver-operating curve of the model with clinical predictors and metabolite risk score was 0.93. Glycochenodeoxycholic acid (OR = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.31-0.87, p = 0.023) was significantly lower in post-baseline/baseline ratios of CVAE patients compared with no-CVAE patients.

        "Abstract": "Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), also known as somatomedin C, is essential for the regulation of animal growth and development. In many species, the IGF1 gene can be alternatively spliced into multiple transcripts, encoding different pre-pro-IGF1 proteins. However, the exact alternative splicing patterns of IGF1 and the sequence information of different splice variants in sheep are still unclear. In this study, four splice variants (class 1-Ea, class 1-Eb, class 2-Ea, and class 2-Eb) were obtained, but no IGF1 Ec, similar to that found in other species, was discovered. Bioinformatics analysis showed that the four splice variants shared the same mature peptide (70 amino acids) and possessed distinct signal peptides and E peptides. Tissue expression analysis indicated that the four splice variants were broadly expressed in all tested tissues and were most abundantly expressed in the liver. In most tissues and stages, the expression of class 1-Ea was highest, and the expression of other splice variants was low. Overall, levels of the four IGF1 splice variants at the fetal and lamb stages were higher than those at the adult stage. Overexpression of the four splice variants significantly increased fibroblast proliferation and inhibited apoptosis (P < 0.05). In contrast, silencing IGF1 Ea or IGF1 Eb with siRNA significantly inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis (P < 0.05). Among the four splice variants, class 1-Ea had a more evident effect on cell proliferation and apoptosis. In summary, the four ovine IGF1 splice variants have different structures and expression patterns and might have different biological functions.",

        "Abstract": "Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), also known as somatomedin C, is essential for the regulation of animal growth and development. In many species, the IGF1 gene can be alternatively spliced into multiple transcripts, encoding different pre-pro-IGF1 proteins. However, the exact alternative splicing patterns of IGF1 and the sequence information of different splice variants in sheep are still unclear. In this study, four splice variants (class 1-Ea, class 1-Eb, class 2-Ea, and class 2-Eb) were obtained, but no IGF1 Ec, similar to that found in other species, was discovered. Bioinformatics analysis showed that the four splice variants shared the same mature peptide (70 amino acids) and possessed distinct signal peptides and E peptides. Tissue expression analysis indicated that the four splice variants were broadly expressed in all tested tissues and were most abundantly expressed in the liver. In most tissues and stages, the expression of class 1-Ea was highest, and the expression of other splice variants was low. Overall, levels of the four IGF1 splice variants at the fetal and lamb stages were higher than those at the adult stage. Overexpression of the four splice variants significantly increased fibroblast proliferation and inhibited apoptosis (P < 0.05).

The aim of this study is to investigate LC proliferation regulated by metabolite-mediated IGF1R lactylation. IGF1R was highly expressed in LC tissues and cells, and the effects of IGF1R on protein stability were inhibited by Lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) inhibition. Moreover, the tightness of IGF1R binding to IGF1 was also enhanced by exogenous lactic acid but suppressed by LDHA silencing, while cell viability and proliferation were promoted by over-expression of IGF1R. Exogenous lactic acid further exacerbated the effects of the IGF1R gene, while LDHA knocking down reduced the IGF1R-induced malignant behaviors. The IGF1R and exogenous lactic acid were also found to increase extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) and decrease oxygen consumption rate to regulate glycolysis, which was inhibited by LDHA deficiency in LC cells. The study concluded that IGF1R-mediated aggressive behaviors of LC cells were associated with higher levels of IGF1R lactylation. Moreover, lactic acid can improve the protein stability of the IGF1R oncogene, thus promoting glycolysis and generating lactic acid, forming a closed loop. Therefore, targeting IGF1R is envisaged to provide a novel strategy for developing therapeutic agents against LC.",
