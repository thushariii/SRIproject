        "Abstract": "The present study explored patterns of circulating metabolites and proteins that can predict future risk for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). We conducted a prospective nested case-control study in northern Sweden in individuals who developed STEMI (N = 50) and NSTEMI (N = 50) within 5 years and individually matched controls (N = 100). Fasted plasma samples were subjected to multiplatform mass spectrometry-based metabolomics and multiplex protein analyses. Multivariate analyses were used to elucidate infarction-specific metabolite and protein risk profiles associated with future incident STEMI and NSTEMI. We found that altered lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) to lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE) ratio predicted STEMI and NSTEMI events in different ways. In STEMI, lysophospholipids (mainly LPEs) were lower, whereas in NSTEMI, lysophospholipids (mainly LPEs) were higher. We found a similar response for all detected lysophospholipids but significant alterations only for those containing linoleic acid (C18:2,",

        "Abstract": "Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is a disulphide-linked heterodimer of two polypeptide chains, the A and B chains, which are encoded by genes on separate chromosomes. The A-chain gene is transcribed in a number of transformed and non-transformed cell lines and is inducible by a wide variety of growth factors, cytokines and other mitogenic agonists. To localize DNA elements that mediate basal transcription in the promoter regulatory region of the A-chain gene, we have employed 5'-endpoint deletion mutagenesis and transient expression analysis in the renal epithelial cell line BSC-1 (African green monkey). Studies conducted in this cell line, which expresses high concentrations of PDGF A-chain mRNA, reveal a positive regulatory element (PRE) in a GC-rich stretch of the A-chain promoter between -82 and -40, relative to the transcription start site. Two discrete regions of the promoter were identified as negative regulatory elements (NREs), located between -1029 and -880 (NRE1) and between -1800 and -1029 (NRE2). The -1800 to -812 region, which contains both NREs, functions as a potent NRE when relocated in either orientation adjacent to the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter, reducing transcription activity by 60% in the positive orientation and 85% in the negative orientation. Comparison of BSC-1 cells and Saos-2 cells (human osteogenic sarcoma), which do not express significant quantities of PDGF A-chain mRNA or protein, indicates that basal transcription of the gene is determined by enhancer activity mediated by the GC-rich region rather than through de-repression of the upstream NREs. Electrophoretic gel mobility shift assays reveal a complex pattern of nuclear protein binding to the GC-rich PRE (-73 to -46). Competition studies conducted with mutant oligonucleotides that alternately disrupt consensus binding sites for Sp-1 or Egr-1 demonstrate a requirement for the presence of an Sp1-like core sequence (GGCGGG) but not Egr-1/Krox-24 [GCG(G/T)-GGGCG] for the formation of specific DNA-protein complexes. Our observations suggest that basal transcription of the A-chain gene in renal epithelial cells is achieved through active enhancement, mediated by a GC-rich PRE and nuclear proteins that bind to Sp-1-like consensus DNA sequences.",

        "Abstract": "1. The effects of the thromboxane A2 (TxA2)-mimetic, U-46619, on the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were examined in a clonal smooth muscle cell line, A10, which was derived from foetal rat aorta. 2. [3H]-U-46619 bound to A10 cells of passages 18-20 (p18-20) with two classes of sites. The high affinity site showed a Bmax of 3.0 +/- 1.8 fmol mg-1 protein with a KD value 1.0 +/- 0.1 nM, while the low affinity site showed a Bmax of 43.0 +/- 6.0 fmol mg-1 protein and KD value of 129.0 +/- 7.9 nM. However, [3H]-U-46619 bound to A10 cells from passages 28-30 (p28-30) at a single class of site with a Bmax 111.0 +/- 9.0 fmol mg-1 protein and a KD value of 175.4 +/- 22.0 nM. 3. Cinnamophilin and SQ29548 inhibited specific [3H]-U-46619 binding to p18-20 A10 cells in a concentration-dependent manner with Ki values of 390.0 +/- 3.2 and 4.6 +/- 1.0 nM, respectively at a high affinity site, and 2.6 +/- 0.2 microM and 310.0 +/- 6.4 nM, respectively at the low affinity site. 4. U-46619 produced isometric contractions of rat aorta in a concentration-dependent manner with an EC50 7.0 +/- 1.2 nM. Cinnamophilin and SQ29548 antagonized U-46619-induced aortic contractions with pA2 values 6.3 +/- 0.1 and 8.2 +/- 0.2, respectively. 5. U-46619 increased [3H]-thymidine incorporation into DNA of p18-20 and p28-30 A10 cells in aconcentration-dependent manner with EC50 values 362.7 +/- 27.0 and 302.5 +/- 20.1 nm, respectively. The U-46619-induced increase of [3H]-thymidine incorporation into DNA of p28 -30 AO0 cells was potentiatedby PDGF (1 ng ml-1) and FCS (1%) and was inhibited by cinnamophilin (10 microM) and SQ29548 (1 microM)with estimated pKB values 5.4 +/- 1.2 and 6.3 +/- 0.9, respectively.6. Cell cycle analysis revealed that U-46619-increased cell cycle progression was primarily due to a rapidtransition from the DNA synthetic (S) to the G2/mitotic (M) phase. Moreover, U-46619 also increasedprotein synthesis and cell numbers in VSMC. All these effects of U-46619 were inhibited bycinnamophilin and SQ29548.7. U-46619 caused phosphoinositide breakdown and increased the intracellular Ca2+ concentration inVSMC, effects which were blocked by cinnamophilin and SQ29548.8 These data indicate there are two U-46619 binding sites in AlO VSMC. The high affinity site is correlated to U-46619-induced vasoconstriction while the low affinity site is correlated to U-46619-mediated VSMC proliferation. These data also reveal that U-46619 stimulates the cell cycle progression in VSMC primarily through a rapid transition from S to G2/M. Since cinnamophilin inhibits TPreceptor-mediated VSMC proliferation, it may thus hold promising potential for the prevention of atherosclerosis or vascular diseases.",

        "Abstract": "Comparative analysis of cosmid clones containing the human and feline c-sis genetic regions revealed the similar structural organization of these areas in the two species. The areas shared seven different genetic regions in and around the c-sis locus and of these was related to v-sis. Another region, 1.9 kbp in size and located about 8 kbp upstream of the v-sis homologous region in the human genome, also hybridized to the main c-sis transcriptional product of 3.5 kb. Comparison with a recently described c-sis cDNA clone (Collins et al., Nature 316, 748-750 (1985)) revealed that the 1.9 kbp DNA region contained a large 5' c-sis exon of at least 1050 bp. In this exon, the presumed initiation site of the predicted PDGF-2 containing precursor protein was located and appeared to be preceded by a large untranslated region. In the region immediately upstream of this exon, a TATA box and a consensus sequence for a potential Sp1 binding site were found at similar positions in both species. This region also exhibited promoter activity when tested in an assay in which coding sequences of bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT; acetyl-CoA: chloramphenicol 3-O-acetyltransferase, EC 2.3.1.28) were placed under its control. The five other DNA regions were found upstream and downstream of the human c-sis transcription unit and also in an intron. Four of them contained repetitive sequences. Hybridization analysis of human and feline c-sis containing cosmid clones with a mixed synthetic nucleotide probe, which corresponded to sequences encoding amino acid residues 2-7 of chain 1 of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-1), suggested that the c-sis cosmid clones did not include PDGF-1-specific genetic sequences.",

        "Abstract": "The present studies investigated the expression of the two PDGF genes (c-sis/PDGF-2 and PDGF-1) and the PDGF-receptor b gene (PDGF-R) in 34 primary human astrocytomas. Northern blot analysis demonstrated the coexpression of the c-sis/PDGF-2 protooncogene and the PDGF-R gene in all astrocytomas examined. The majority of the tumors also expressed the PDGF-1 gene. There was no correlation between the expression of the two PDGF genes. Nonmalignant human brain tissue expressed the PDGF-R and PDGF-1 genes but not the c-sis/PDGF-2 protooncogene. In situ hybridization of astrocytoma tissue localized the expression of the c-sis and PDGF-R mRNA's in tumor cells. Capillary endothelial cells also expressed c-sis mRNA. In contrast, nonmalignant human brain tissue expressed only PDGF-R mRNA but not c-sis/PDGF-2 mRNA. The coexpression of a potent mitogenic growth factor protooncogene (c-sis) and its receptor gene in astrocytoma tumor cells suggests the presence of an autocrine mechanism that may contribute to the development and maintenance of astrocytomas. The expression of c-sis mRNA in tumor cells but not in nonmalignant brain cells may serve as an additional diagnostic criterion for the detection of astrocytomas in small tissue specimen using in situ hybridization for the detection of c-sis mRNA and/or immunostaining for the recognition of its protein product.",

We conducted a prospective nested case-control study in northern Sweden in individuals who developed STEMI (N = 50) and NSTEMI (N = 50) within 5 years and individually matched controls (N = 100). Fasted plasma samples were subjected to multiplatform mass spectrometry-based metabolomics and multiplex protein analyses. Multivariate analyses were used to elucidate infarction-specific metabolite and protein risk profiles associated with future incident STEMI and NSTEMI. We found that altered lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) to lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE) ratio predicted STEMI and NSTEMI events in different ways. In STEMI, lysophospholipids (mainly LPEs) were lower, whereas in NSTEMI, lysophospholipids (mainly LPEs) were higher. We found a similar response for all detected lysophospholipids but significant alterations only for those containing linoleic acid (C18:2,",

The combined application of immunosuppressants with multiple targets presents a novel direction in the treatment of kidney diseases. The present study was designed to explore the inhibitory effects of tacrolimus (TAC) combined with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) on the proliferation of mesangial cells based on the cell cycle. In vitro, the levels of the proliferation index markers, Ki67 and cyclin D1, in human mesangial cells (HMCs) were determined by immunofluorescence staining and western blot analysis, respectively. In mice with lupus nephritis (LN), the proliferation of mesangial cells was determined using PAS and Masson's trichrome staining, while immunohistochemistry was used to detect Ki67 and western blot analysis was employed for the evaluation of cyclin D1 levels. The expression of platelet‑derived growth factor (PDGF), a proliferation‑associated protein, was estimated using immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis. In patients with LN, Ki67, cyclin D1 and PDGF expression was estimated by immunohistochemistry. The transforming growth factor‑β1/Smad pathway influenced by TAC and the p38 pathway influenced by MMF were also examined by western blot analysis. The results suggested that the combination of TAC and MMF at half the concentration based on the cell cycle was more effective than monotherapy in inhibiting mesangial cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. TAC inhibited HMC proliferation by affecting the Smad2 signaling pathway. MMF inhibited HMC proliferation by affecting the p38 signaling pathway. Combined treatment with TAC and MMF significantly improved the clinical indexes of patients with LN without severe adverse effects. On the whole, the findings of the present study validate and reinforce the potential use of the combination of TAC and MMF for the treatment of mesangial proliferative diseases.",
