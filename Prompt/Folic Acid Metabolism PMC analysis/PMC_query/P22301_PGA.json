        "Abstract": "Ensuring sufficient protein intake, efficient digestion, and optimal absorption are crucial for the elderly. This study aims to investigate the potential of a compound dietary fiber, consisting of mulberry leaf and konjac flour (CMK), to enhance the digestion and absorption of a high-fish-protein diet in elderly mice. Results showed that CMK effectively reduced the number of unique peptide segments, generated short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) in feces, improved the content of glutamic pyruvic transaminase (GPT), glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT), amino acid, and urea nitrogen in serum, activated the contents of pepsin, trypsin, and erepsin, and enhanced the expression of glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), peptide transporter 1 (PepT1), and aminopeptidase N (APN). Furthermore, CMK demonstrated its ability to decrease the levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-10 (IL-10), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP), while increase the abundance of beneficial bacteria, such as",
