        "Abstract": "Folic acid (FA) intake has been associated with increased breast cancer risk in some studies. Although underlying mechanisms are unknown, epigenetic modifications that persistently alter transcription have been suggested. We tested the hypothesis that high FA (HFA) intake alters the adult mammary transcriptome in a manner consistent with increased potential for carcinogenesis, detectable beyond the period of intake. C57BL/6 mice were fed control FA (CFA) (1 mg/kg diet) or HFA (5 mg/kg diet) diets for 4 weeks, followed by AIN93M maintenance diet for 4 weeks. Plasma 5-methyltetrahydrofolate,",
