        "Abstract": "Three new 3-amino-6-hydroxy-2-piperidone (Ahp)-containing cyclic depsipeptides, named loggerpeptins A-C (1-3), along with molassamide (4), were discovered from a marine cyanobacterium, extending the structural diversity of this prevalent scaffold of cyanobacterial serine protease inhibitors. Molassamide, which contains a 2-amino-butenoic (Abu) unit in the cyclic core, was the most potent and selective analogue against human neutrophil elastase (HNE). Given the growing evidence supporting the role of HNE in breast cancer progression and metastasis, we assessed the cellular effects of compounds 3 and 4 in the context of targeting invasive breast cancer. Both compounds inhibited cleavage of the elastase substrate CD40 in biochemical assays; however, only 4 exhibited significant cellular activity. As CD40 and other receptor proteolytic processing culminates in NFκB activation, we assessed the effects of 4 on the expression of target genes, including ICAM-1. ICAM-1 is also a direct target of elastase and, in our studies, compound 4 attenuated both elastase-induced ICAM-1 gene expression and ICAM-1 proteolytic processing by elastase, revealing a potential dual effect on migration through modulation of gene expression and proteolytic processing. Molassamide also specifically inhibited the elastase-mediated migration of highly invasive triple-negative breast cancer cells.",

        "Abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by synovial fibroblast hyperplasia and bone erosion. Fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) play a pivotal role in RA pathogenesis through aggressive migration and matrix invasion, and certain proinflammatory cytokines may affect synoviocyte invasion. Whether interleukin (IL)-21 influences this process remains controversial. Here, we evaluated the potential regulatory effect of IL-21 on the migration, invasion and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression in RA-FLS. We found that IL-21 promoted the migration, invasion and MMP (MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-9, MMP-13) production in RA-FLS. Moreover, IL-21 induced activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT-3) and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) pathways, and blockage of these pathways [PI3K/protein kinase B (AKT) inhibitor LY294002, STAT-3 inhibitor STA-21 and ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059] attenuated IL-21-induced migration and secretion of MMP-3 and MMP-9. In conclusion, our results suggest that IL-21 promotes migration and invasion of RA-FLS. Therefore, therapeutic strategies targeting IL-21 might be effective for the treatment of RA.",

        "Abstract": "(1S,2E,4R,6R,-7E,11E)-2,7,11-cembratriene-4,6-diol (4R) is a precursor to key flavor ingredients in leaves of Nicotiana species. The present study shows 4R decreased brain damage in rodent ischemic stroke models. The 4R-pretreated mice had lower infarct volumes (26.2±9.7 mm3) than those in control groups (untreated: 63.4±4.2 mm3, DMSO: 60.2±14.2 mm3). The 4R-posttreated rats also had less infarct volumes (120±65 mm3) than those in the rats of the DMSO group (291±95 mm3). The results from in vitro experiments indicate that 4R decreased neuro2a cell (neuroblastoma cells) apoptosis induced by oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD), and improved the population spikes' (PSs) recovery in rat acute hippocampal slices under OGD; a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, wortmannin, abolished the effect of 4R on PSs recovery. Furthermore, 4R also inhibited monocyte adhesion to murine brain-derived endothelial (bEND5) cells and upregulation of intercellular adhesion molecule-1(ICAM-1) induced by OGD/reoxygenation (OGD/R), and restored the p-Akt level to pre-OGD/R values in bEND5 cells. In conclusion, the present study indicates that 4R has a protective effect in rodent ischemic stroke models. Inhibition of ICAM-1 expression and restoration of Akt phosphorylation are the possible mechanisms involved in cellular protection by 4R.",
