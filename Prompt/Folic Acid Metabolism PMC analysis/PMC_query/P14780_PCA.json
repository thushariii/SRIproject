        "Abstract": "The procoagulatory serine protease, thrombin, is known to induce invasion and metastasis in various cancers, but the mechanisms by which it promotes tumorigenesis are poorly understood. Because the 92-kDa gelatinase (MMP-9) is a known mediator of tumor cell invasion, we sought to determine whether and how thrombin regulates MMP-9. The thrombin receptor, PAR-1, and MMP-9 are expressed in osteosarcomas, as determined by immunohistochemistry. Stimulation of U2-OS osteosarcoma cells with thrombin and a thrombin receptor-activating peptide induced pro-MMP-9 secretion as well as cell surface-associated pro-MMP-9 expression and proteolytic activity. This was paralleled by an increase in MMP-9 mRNA and MMP-9 promoter activity. Thrombin-induced invasion of U2-OS cells through Matrigel was mediated by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling pathway and could be inhibited with an MMP-9 antibody. The stimulation of MMP-9 by thrombin was paralleled by an increase in beta1-integrin mRNA and beta1-integrin expression on the cell surface, which was also mediated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and was required for invasion. Thrombin activation induced and co-localized both beta1-integrin and pro-MMP-9 on the cell membrane, as evidenced by co-immunoprecipitation, confocal microscopy, and a protein binding assay. The thrombin-mediated association of these two proteins, as well as thrombin-mediated invasion of U2-OS cells, could be blocked with a cyclic peptide and with an antibody preventing binding of the MMP-9 hemopexin domain to beta1-integrin. These results suggest that thrombin induces expression and association of beta1-integrin with MMP-9 and that the cell surface localization of the protease by the integrin promotes tumor cell invasion.",

        "Abstract": "Meningiomas are tumours derived from the arachnoid and pia mater. During embryogenesis, these membranes develop from the migrating craniofacial neural crest. We have previously demonstrated that meningiomas have characteristic features of embryonic meninges. Craniofacial neural crest derivatives are affected during normal development and migration by retinoic acid. We speculated, therefore, that meningioma cell migration and invasion would be affected in a similar way. In this study we investigated the mechanisms of invasion and migration in meningiomas and the effects of retinoic acid (RA). We found that low doses of RA inhibit in vitro invasion in meningioma cells, without affecting cell proliferation or viability. The matrix metalloproteinases MMP-2 (72 kDa gelatinase) and MMP-9 (92 kDa gelatinase), which play a key role in invasion in other tumours, are not affected by RA. RA inhibits cell migration on collagen I and fibronectin. A possible mechanism for these effects is provided by the fact that RA strongly stimulates adhesion of meningioma cells to extracellular matrix substrates. As in vitro invasion, migration and decreased adhesion to the extracellular matrix correlate with the clinical manifestation of tumour invasion, we conclude that RA induces a non-invasive phenotype in meningioma cells.",

        "Abstract": "Recent studies have demonstrated the existence of a soluble fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor type 1 (FGFR1) extracellular domain in the circulation and in vascular basement membranes. However, the process of FGFR1 ectodomain release from the plasma membrane is not known. Here we report that the 72-kDa gelatinase A (matrix metalloproteinase type 2, MMP2) can hydrolyze the Val368-Met369 peptide bond of the FGFR1 ectodomain, eight amino acids upstream of the transmembrane domain, thus releasing the entire extracellular domain. Similar results were obtained regardless of whether FGF was first bound to the receptor or not. The action of MMP2 abolished binding of FGF to an immobilized recombinant FGFR1 ectodomain fusion protein and to Chinese hamster ovary cells overexpressing FGFR1 The released recombinant FGFR1 ectodomain was able to bind FGF after MMP2 cleavage, suggesting that the cleaved soluble receptor maintained its FGF binding capacity. The activity of MMP2 could not be reproduced by the 92-kDa gelatinase B (MMP9) and was inhibited by tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase type 2. These studies demonstrate that FGFR1 may be a specific target for MMP2 on the cell surface, yielding a soluble FGF receptor that may modulate the mitogenic and angiogenic activities of FGF.",

        "Abstract": "Tenascin (TN) is a large oligomeric glycoprotein that is present transiently in the extracellular matrix (ECM) of cells and is involved in morphogenetic movements, tissue patterning, and tissue repair. It has multiple domains, both adhesive and anti-adhesive, that interact with cells and with fibronectin (FN) and other ECM macromolecules. We have studied the consequences of the interaction of TN with a FN matrix on gene expression in rabbit synovial fibroblasts. Fibroblasts plated on a mixed substrate of FN and TN, but not on FN alone, upregulated synthesis of four genes: collagenase, stromelysin, the 92-kDa gelatinase, and c-fos. Although the fibroblasts spread well on both FN and FN/TN substrates, nuclear c-Fos increased within 1 h only in cells that were plated on FN/TN. TN did not induce the expression of collagenase in cells plated on substrates of type I collagen or vitronectin (VN). Moreover, soluble TN added to cells adhering to a FN substrate or to serum proteins had no effect, suggesting that TN has an effect only in the context of mixed substrates of FN and TN. Collagenase increased within 4 h of plating on a FN/TN substrate and exhibited kinetics similar to those for induction of collagenase gene expression by signaling through the integrin FN receptor. Arg-Gly-Asp peptide ligands that recognize either the FN receptor or the VN receptor and function-perturbing anti-integrin monoclonal antibodies diminished the interaction of fibroblasts with a mixed substrate of FN, TN, and VN, but had no effect on the adhesion of fibroblasts to a substrate of FN and VN, suggesting that both receptors recognize the complex. Anti-TN68, an antibody that recognizes an epitope in the carboxyl-terminal type III repeats involved in the interaction of TN with both FN and cells, blocked the inductive effect of the FN/TN substrate, whereas anti-TNM1, an antibody that recognizes an epitope in the amino-terminal anti-adhesive region of epidermal growth factor-like repeats, had no effect. These data suggest that transient alteration of the composition of ECM by addition of proteins like TN may regulate the expression of genes involved in cell migration, tissue remodeling, and tissue invasion, in regions of tissue undergoing phenotypic changes.",

The study involved the exposure of pregnant Wistar rats to various regulatory-relevant doses of glyphosate, ranging from gestational day 6 until fine of the lactation period. Glyphosate doses corresponded to the European Union's glyphosate-acceptable daily intake (ADI; 0.5mg/kg bw/day) and no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL; 50mg/kg bw/day). The dose of the mixture of glyphosate, dicamba, and 2,4-D was at the European Union ADI for each herbicide namely 0.5, 0.002, and 0.3mg/kg bw/day, respectively. In the animals exposed to glyphosate NOAEL serum estradiol levels were increased compared to untreated animals, along with an upregulation of TNF-?, MMP-2, and MMP-9 as measured in mammary gland homogenates compared to non-treated animals. Moreover, in this group, a focally acute inflammatory infiltrate was observed in the mammary gland. Our study showed that short-term exposure to glyphosate at doses that are set as safe by regulators and thus without risk corroborated with a particular physiological state as gestation and lactation, can give rise to inflammatory changes in breast tissue in rats. These findings support the need for further evaluation of glyphosate and mixtures of glyphosate with other pesticides for public health protection, especially for those categories vulnerable to the potential endocrine disruptor properties of these pesticides such as pregnant women, newborns, and children.",

Traces of MMP-9 can be found in the human carious lesions, saliva, and gingival crevicular fluid.

        "Abstract": "Glomerular mesangial cells (MC) play a central role in the synthesis and turnover of the glomerular extracellular matrix. Prior studies [Davies, Thomas, Martin and Lovett (1988) Biochem. J. 251, 419-425; Martin, Davies, Thomas and Lovett (1989) Kidney Int. 36, 790-801] have characterized at the protein level a 72 kDa type IV collagenase that is secreted by cultured human and rat MC. While exposure of most cell types to interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) or phorbol ester has little or even an inhibitory effect on 72 kDa type IV collagenase secretion, these factors significantly increased the synthesis of this enzyme by rat MC. Given this divergent pattern of expression, a homology-based PCR cloning strategy using rat MC cDNA templates was employed to define at the molecular level the structure of the mesangial 72 kDa type IV collagenase. The nucleotide sequence within the open reading frame of the rat mesangial 72 kDa type IV collagenase cDNA diverges from the sequence of the human homologue by approx. 9%. The divergence in the 3' untranslated region was much more extensive. Steady-state levels of the 3.1 kb transcript of the 72 kDa type IV collagenase were low or undetectable in resting MC, but were greatly stimulated following incubation with IL-beta, TNF-alpha or phorbol ester. None of these factors induced synthesis by MC of the closely related 92 kDa type IV collagenase. Synthesis by MC of the 72 kDa type IV collagenase was also induced by second-messenger analogues, including 8-bromo-cyclic AMP and forskolin. It is concluded that MC regulate the expression of this enzyme in an unusual, tissue-specific fashion. Cytokine and second-messenger inducibility may contribute to the enhanced expression of the enzyme during glomerular inflammatory disorders.",

        "Abstract": "Simian virus 40 (SV40)-transformed human lung fibroblasts secrete both 72-kDa type IV collagenase and a closely related 92-kDa type IV collagenase that was not detected in the parental cell line. The 92-kDa type IV procollagenase purified from these cells exists in a noncovalent complex with the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteases, TIMP. Here we report that the 72-kDa type IV procollagenase purified from HRAS-transformed human bronchial epithelial cells, SV40-transformed lung fibroblasts, and normal skin fibroblasts exists in a stable but noncovalent stoichiometric complex with a 24-kDa inhibitor referred to here as \"TIMP-2.\" TIMP-2 is closely related to TIMP, as demonstrated by comparison of the partial amino acid sequence of this protein to that of TIMP, although it does not cross-react with TIMP-specific antibody. The TIMP-2 inhibitor interacts with the 72-kDa type IV collagenase in preference to the 92-kDa type IV collagenase that forms a complex exclusively with TIMP. The 72-kDa type IV collagenase-TIMP-2 complex can be activated with organomercurials to yield a catalytically competent enzyme. Activation occurs concomitantly with autoproteolytic cleavage of the amino terminus of the protein and does not require dissociation of the complex. Both activity and activation of the complex can be completely inhibited by further addition of stoichiometric quantities of purified TIMP-2 or recombinant TIMP.",

Patients who have had an SOT are at higher risk for Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), yet there is little evidence concerning potential antitumour effects of immunosuppressive drugs against MCC. Screening seven immunosuppressive drugs in six MCC cell lines revealed that mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) had strong antitumour activity (surpassing mTOR inhibitors) and higher potency in MCC vs. other cancer types.
