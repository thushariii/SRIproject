        "Abstract": "Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) is the severe form of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease which has a high potential to progress to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, yet adequate effective therapies are lacking. Hypoadiponectinemia is causally involved in the pathogenesis of MASH. This study investigated the pharmacological effects of adiponectin replacement therapy with the adiponectin-derived peptide ALY688 (ALY688-SR) in a mouse model of MASH. Human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell-derived hepatocytes were used to test cytotoxicity and signaling of unmodified ALY688 in vitro. High-fat diet with low methionine and no added choline (CDAHF) was used to induce MASH and test the effects of ALY688-SR in vivo. Histological MASH activity score (NAS) and fibrosis score were determined to assess the effect of ALY688-SR. Transcriptional characterization of mice through RNA sequencing was performed to indicate potential molecular mechanisms involved. In cultured hepatocytes, ALY688 efficiently induced adiponectin-like signaling, including the AMP-activated protein kinase and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, and did not elicit cytotoxicity. Administration of ALY688-SR in mice did not influence body weight but significantly ameliorated CDAHF-induced hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis, therefore effectively preventing the development and progression of MASH. Mechanistically, ALY688-SR treatment markedly induced hepatic expression of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation, whereas it significantly suppressed the expression of pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic genes as demonstrated by transcriptomic analysis. ALY688-SR may represent an effective approach in MASH treatment. Its mode of action involves inhibition of hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis, possibly via canonical adiponectin-mediated signaling.",

        "Abstract": "In budding yeast, fermentation is the most important pathway for energy production. Under low-glucose conditions, ethanol is used for synthesis of this sugar requiring a shift to respiration. This process is controlled by the transcriptional regulators Cat8, Sip4, Rds2 and Ert1. We characterized Gsm1 (glucose starvation modulator 1), a paralog of Rds2 and Ert1. Genome-wide analysis showed that Gsm1 has a DNA binding profile highly similar to Rds2. Binding of Gsm1 and Rds2 is interdependent at the gluconeogenic gene FBP1. However, Rds2 is required for Gsm1 to bind at other promoters but not the reverse. Gsm1 and Rds2 also bind to DNA independently of each other. Western blot analysis revealed that Rds2 controls expression of Gsm1. In addition, we showed that the DNA binding domains of Gsm1 and Rds2 bind cooperatively in vitro to the FBP1 promoter. In contrast, at the HAP4 gene, Ert1 cooperates with Rds2 for DNA binding. Mutational analysis suggests that Gsm1/Rds2 and Ert1/Rds2 bind to short common DNA stretches, revealing a novel mode of binding for this class of factors. Two-point mutations in a HAP4 site convert it to a Gsm1 binding site. Thus, Rds2 controls binding of Gsm1 at many promoters by two different mechanisms: regulation of Gsm1 levels and increased DNA binding by formation of heterodimers.",

        "Abstract": "Transcription factors (TF) are central to transcriptional regulation, but they are often studied in relative isolation and without close control of the metabolic state of the cell. Here, we describe genome-wide binding (by ChIP-exo) of 15 yeast TFs in four chemostat conditions that cover a range of metabolic states. We integrate this data with transcriptomics and six additional recently mapped TFs to identify predictive models describing how TFs control gene expression in different metabolic conditions. Contributions by TFs to gene regulation are predicted to be mostly activating, additive and well approximated by assuming linear effects from TF binding signal. Notably, using TF binding peaks from peak finding algorithms gave distinctly worse predictions than simply summing the low-noise and high-resolution TF ChIP-exo reads on promoters. Finally, we discover indications of a novel functional role for three TFs; Gcn4, Ert1 and Sut1 during nitrogen limited aerobic fermentation. In only this condition, the three TFs have correlated binding to a large number of genes (enriched for glycolytic and translation processes) and a negative correlation to target gene transcript levels.",

Targets of the MAP kinase pathway are located within several cellular compartments. Signal transduction therefore requires the localization of MAP kinase in each sub-cellular compartment that contains physiologically relevant substrates. Here, we show that serum treatment causes the translocation of two human MAP kinase isoforms, p40mapk and p41mapk, from the cytosol into the nucleus. In addition, we report that p41mapk (but not p40mapk) is localized at the cell surface ruffling membrane in serum-treated cells. To investigate whether the protein kinase activity of MAP kinase is required for serum-induced redistribution within the cell, we constructed mutated kinase-negative forms of p40mapk and p41mapk. The kinase-negative MAP kinases were not observed to localize to the cell surface ruffling membrane. In contrast, the kinase-negative MAP kinases were observed to be translocated to the nucleus. Intrinsic MAP kinase activity is therefore required only for localization at the cell surface and is not required for transport into the nucleus. Together, these data demonstrate that the pattern of serum-induced redistribution of p40mapk is different from p41mapk. Thus, in addition to common targets of signal transduction, it is possible that these MAP kinase isoforms may differentially regulate targets located in distinct sub-cellular compartments.",

It was also discovered that PfMAP2 is expressed in its highest quantity during the early trophozoite (ring form) stage and significantly reduced in the mature trophozoite and schizont stages. Although the phosphorylated form of the kinase is always more prevalent, its ratio relative to the nonphosphorylated form remained constant irrespective of the parasites' developmental stage. We have also shown that the TSH motif specifically renders PfMAP2 genetically divergent from the other plasmodial MAP kinase activation sites using Neighbour Joining analysis. Furthermore, TSH motif-specific designed antibody is crucial in determining the location of the expression of the PfMAP2 protein. However, by using immunoelectron microscopy, PPfMAP2 were detected ubiquitously in the parasitized erythrocytes. In summary, PfMAP2 may play a far more important role than previously thought and is a worthy candidate for research as an antimalarial.",

We object to elucidate that protective effect of H2S on endothelium is mediated by downregulating BMP4 (bone morphogenetic protein 4)/cyclooxygenase- (COX-) 2 pathway in rats with hypertension. Methods and Results. The hypertensive rat model induced by two-kidney one-clip (2K1C) model was used. Exogenous NaHS administration (56 μmol/kg/day, intraperitoneally once a day) reduced mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 2K1C rats from 199.9 ± 3.312 mmHg to 159.4 ± 5.434 mmHg, while NaHS did not affect the blood pressure in the Sham rats and ameliorated endothelium-dependent contractions (EDCs) of renal artery in 2K1C rats. 2K1C reduced CSE level twofold, decreased plasma levels of H2S about 6-fold, increased BMP4, Nox2, and Nox4 levels 2-fold and increased markers of oxidative stress MDA and nitrotyrosine 1.5-fold, upregulated the expression of phosphorylation-p38 MAPK 2-fold, and increased protein levels of COX-2 1.5-fold, which were abolished by NaHS treatment.

        "Abstract": "The compounds 4-vinylcyclohexene 1,2-monoepoxide (VCM) and 4-Vinylcyclohexene diepoxide (VCD) are the two downstream metabolites of 4-vinylcyclohexene (VCH), an ovotoxic agent in mammals. In addition, VCM and VCD may be found as by-products of VCH oxidation in the environment. Recently, we reported the involvement of oxidative stress in the toxicity of VCH in Drosophila melanogaster. However, it was not possible to determine the individual contributions of VCM and VCD in VCH toxicity. Hence, we investigated the toxicity of VCM and VCD (10-1000 µM) in flies after 5 days of exposure via the diet. Our results indicated impairments in climbing behaviour and disruptions in antioxidant balance and redox status evidenced by an increase in DCFH oxidation, decreases in total thiol content and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity in the flies exposed to VCM and VCD (p<0.05). These effects were accompanied by disruptions in the transcription of the genes encoding the proteins superoxide dismutase (SOD1), kelch-like erythroid-derived cap-n-collar (CNC) homology (ECH)-associated protein 1 (Keap-1), mitogen activated protein kinase 2 (MAPK-2), catalase, Cyp18a1, JAFRAC 1 (thioredoxin peroxidase 1) and thioredoxin reductase 1 (TrxR-1) (p<0.05). VCM and VCD inhibited acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and delta aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (δ-ALA D) activities in the flies (p<0.05). Indeed, here, we demonstrated that different target enzymes and genes were modified by the electrophiles VCM and VCD in the flies. Thus, D. melanogaster has provided further lessons on the toxicity of VCM and VCD which suggest that the reported toxicity of VCH may be mediated by its transformation to VCM and VCD.",

        "Abstract": "Advances in gene sequencing technologies have accelerated the identification of genetic variants, but better tools are needed to understand which are causal of disease. This would be particularly useful in fields where gene therapy is a potential therapeutic modality for a disease-causing variant such as inherited retinal disease (IRD). Here, we apply structure-based network analysis (SBNA), which has been successfully utilized to identify variant-constrained amino acid residues in viral proteins, to identify residues that may cause IRD if subject to missense mutation. SBNA is based entirely on structural first principles and is not fit to specific outcome data, which makes it distinct from other contemporary missense prediction tools. In 4 well-studied human disease-associated proteins (BRCA1, HRAS, PTEN, and ERK2) with high-quality structural data, we find that SBNA scores correlate strongly with deep mutagenesis data. When applied to 47 IRD genes with available high-quality crystal structure data, SBNA scores reliably identified disease-causing variants according to phenotype definitions from the ClinVar database. Finally, we applied this approach to 63 patients at Massachusetts Eye and Ear (MEE) with IRD but for whom no genetic cause had been identified. Untrained models built using SBNA scores and BLOSUM62 scores for IRD-associated genes successfully predicted the pathogenicity of novel variants (AUC = 0.851), allowing us to identify likely causative disease variants in 40 IRD patients. Model performance was further augmented by incorporating orthogonal data from EVE scores (AUC = 0.927), which are based on evolutionary multiple sequence alignments. In conclusion, SBNA can used to successfully identify variants as causal of disease in human proteins and may help predict variants causative of IRD in an unbiased fashion.",

        "Abstract": "Advances in gene sequencing technologies have accelerated the identification of genetic variants, but better tools are needed to understand which are causal of disease. This would be particularly useful in fields where gene therapy is a potential therapeutic modality for a disease-causing variant such as inherited retinal disease (IRD). Here, we apply structure-based network analysis (SBNA), which has been successfully utilized to identify variant-constrained amino acid residues in viral proteins, to identify residues that may cause IRD if subject to missense mutation. SBNA is based entirely on structural first principles and is not fit to specific outcome data, which makes it distinct from other contemporary missense prediction tools. In 4 well-studied human disease-associated proteins (BRCA1, HRAS, PTEN, and ERK2) with high-quality structural data, we find that SBNA scores correlate strongly with deep mutagenesis data. When applied to 47 IRD genes with available high-quality crystal structure data, SBNA scores reliably identified disease-causing variants according to phenotype definitions from the ClinVar database. Finally, we applied this approach to 63 patients at Massachusetts Eye and Ear (MEE) with IRD but for whom no genetic cause had been identified. Untrained models built using SBNA scores and BLOSUM62 scores for IRD-associated genes successfully predicted the pathogenicity of novel variants (AUC = 0.851), allowing us to identify likely causative disease variants in 40 IRD patients. Model performance was further augmented by incorporating orthogonal data from EVE scores (AUC = 0.927), which are based on evolutionary multiple sequence alignments. In conclusion, SBNA can used to successfully identify variants as causal of disease in human proteins and may help predict variants causative of IRD in an unbiased fashion.",

        "Abstract": "Macrophages play critical roles in inflammation and tissue homeostasis, and their functions are regulated by various autocrine, paracrine, and endocrine factors. We have previously shown that CTRP6, a secreted protein of the C1q family, targets both adipocytes and macrophages to promote obesity-linked inflammation. However, the gene programs and signaling pathways directly regulated by CTRP6 in macrophages remain unknown. Here, we combine transcriptomic and phosphoproteomic analyses to show that CTRP6 activates inflammatory gene programs and signaling pathways in mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). Treatment of BMDMs with CTRP6 upregulated proinflammatory, and suppressed the antiinflammatory, gene expression. We also showed that CTRP6 activates p44/42-MAPK, p38-MAPK, and NF-κB signaling pathways to promote inflammatory cytokine secretion from BMDMs, and that pharmacologic inhibition of these signaling pathways markedly attenuated the effects of CTRP6. Pretreatment of BMDMs with CTRP6 also sensitized and potentiated the BMDMs response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory signaling and cytokine secretion. Consistent with the metabolic phenotype of proinflammatory macrophages, CTRP6 treatment induced a shift toward aerobic glycolysis and lactate production, reduced oxidative metabolism, and elevated mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production in BMDMs. Importantly, in accordance with our in vitro findings, BMDMs from CTRP6-deficient mice were less inflammatory at baseline and showed a marked suppression of LPS-induced inflammatory gene expression and cytokine secretion. Finally, loss of CTRP6 in mice also dampened LPS-induced inflammation and hypothermia. Collectively, our findings suggest that CTRP6 regulates and primes the macrophage response to inflammatory stimuli and thus may have a role in modulating tissue inflammatory tone in different physiological and disease contexts.",

        "Abstract": "c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) is a mitogen-activated protein kinase family member that is activated by diverse stimuli, including cytokines (such as tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-1), reactive oxygen species (ROS), pathogens, toxins, drugs, endoplasmic reticulum stress, free fatty acids, and metabolic changes. Upon activation, JNK induces multiple biologic events through the transcription factor activator protein-1 and transcription-independent control of effector molecules. JNK isozymes regulate cell death and survival, differentiation, proliferation, ROS accumulation, metabolism, insulin signaling, and carcinogenesis in the liver. The biologic functions of JNK are isoform, cell type, and context dependent. Recent studies using genetically engineered mice showed that loss or hyperactivation of the JNK pathway contributes to the development of inflammation, fibrosis, cancer growth, and metabolic diseases that include obesity, hepatic steatosis, and insulin resistance. We review the functions and pathways of JNK in liver physiology and pathology and discuss findings from preclinical studies with JNK inhibitors.",
