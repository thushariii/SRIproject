        "Abstract": "Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a mitogen for endothelial cells, and it promotes angiogenesis in vivo. Here we report that VEGF(165) has neurotrophic actions on cultured adult mouse superior cervical ganglia (SCG) and dorsal root ganglia (DRG), measured as axonal outgrowth. Maximal effect was observed at 10-50 ng/ml for SCG and 100 ng/ml for DRG. VEGF-induced axonal outgrowth was inhibited by the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitor PD 98059 but not by the protein kinase inhibitor K252a. VEGF also increased survival of both neurons and satellite cells and the number of proliferating Schwann cells. Immunocytochemistry and immunoblotting revealed that VEGF was expressed in virtually all nerve cells in the SCG but only in a population of small-diameter (<35 micrometers) neurons representing approximately 30% of the neurons in DRG. Immunostaining showed that the VEGF receptor fetal liver kinase receptor (flk-1) was found on nerve cell bodies in DRG and to a lesser extent on neurons in SCG. Growth cones of regenerating axons from both types of ganglia exhibited flk-1 immunoreactivity, as did Schwann cells. We conclude that VEGF has both neurotrophic and mitogenic activity on cells in the peripheral nervous system.",

        "Abstract": "Myeloid epithelial reproductive proto-oncogene tyrosine kinase (MERTK) plays an essential role in modulating cancer immune tolerance by regulating macrophage efferocytosis. Studies are underway to develop small-molecule chemicals that inhibit MERTK as cancer immunotherapeutic agents, but these efforts are in their early stages. This study identified BMS794833, whose primary targets are MET and VEGFR2, as a potent MERTK inhibitor and developed a real-time efferocytosis monitoring system. The X-ray cocrystal structure revealed that BMS794833 was in contact with the ATP-binding pocket and the allosteric back pocket, rendering MERTK inactive. Homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence kinetic and Western blotting analyses showed that BMS794833 competitively inhibited MERTK activity in vitro and inhibited the autophosphorylation of MERTK in macrophages. We developed a system to monitor MERTK-dependent efferocytosis in real time, and using this system, we confirmed that BMS794833 significantly inhibited the efferocytosis of differentiated macrophages. Finally, BMS794833 significantly inhibited efferocytosis in vivo in a mouse model. These data show that BMS794833 is a type II MERTK inhibitor that regulates macrophage efferocytosis. In addition, the real-time efferocytosis monitoring technology developed in this study has great potential for future applications.",

        "Abstract": "Endothelial diaphragms are subcellular structures critical for mammalian survival with poorly understood biogenesis. Plasmalemma vesicle associated protein (PLVAP) is the only known diaphragm component and is necessary for diaphragm formation. Very little is known about PLVAP regulation. Phorbol esters (PMA) are known to induce de novo PLVAP expression and diaphragm formation. We show that this induction relies on the de novo production of soluble factors that will act in an autocrine manner to induce PLVAP transcription and protein expression. We identified vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) signalling through VEGFR2 as a necessary but not sufficient downstream event as VEGF-A inhibition with antibodies and siRNA or pharmacological inhibition of VEGFR2 only partially inhibit PLVAP upregulation. In terms of downstream pathways, inhibition of MEK1/Erk1/2 MAP kinase blocked PLVAP upregulation, whereas inhibition of p38 and JNK MAP kinases or PI3K and Akt had no effect on PMA-induced PLVAP expression. In conclusion, we show that VEGF-A along with other secreted proteins act synergistically to up-regulate PLVAP in MEK1/Erk1/2 dependent manner, bringing us one step further into understanding the genesis of the essential structures that are endothelial diaphragms.",
