Due to the growing development of severe symptoms, it is necessary to promote effective therapies. Ambroxol [2-amino-3,5-dibromo-N-(trans-4-hydroxycyclohexyl) benzylamine] has long been used as one of the over-the-counter mucolytic agents to treat various respiratory diseases. Therefore, we focused on the mechanism of action of ambroxol in COVID-19 treatment. In vitro and in silico screening revealed that ambroxol may impede cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 by binding to neuropilin-1. Ambroxol could also interact with multiple inflammatory factors and signaling pathways, especially nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), to interfere cytokines cascade activated by SARS-CoV-2 internalization. Furthermore, multipathways and proteins, such as the cell cycle and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), were identified as significant ambroxol-targeting pathways or molecules in PBMC and lung of severe COVID-19 patients by bioinformatics analysis. Collectively, these results suggested that ambroxol may serve as a promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

        "Abstract": "Floridoside is a low-molecular-weight organic compound, which can be accumulated by red algae under stressful conditions to protect cells via its excellent antioxidant properties. In the present study, we investigated the antioxidant mechanism of floridoside toward human hepatocyte L-02 cells. We found that floridoside had no toxicity to L-02 cells, and no reactive oxidative species were induced by it either. However, the expression of hemoxygenase-1 (HO-1) protein was up-regulated upon exposure to floridoside, and two antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and GSH-Px, were activated by floridoside. Moreover, we investigated the pathway involved in the production of these antioxidants, p38/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) MAPK-nuclear factor-erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway. ERK1/2 and p38 phosphorylation, nuclear translocation of Nrf2, and activation of ARE luciferase activity were observed upon exposure to floridoside. siRNA interference and inhibitor treatment suppressed the HO-1 expression and the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38, respectively. These results indicated that floridoside exerted its antioxidant activity by activating HO-1 expression via p38/ERK MAPK-Nrf2 pathway in human hepatocyte L-02 cells.",

        "Abstract": "SC79 is a novel Akt activator. The current study tested its potential effect against oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD)/re-oxygenation-induced myocardial cell death. We showed that SC79 activated Akt and protected H9c2 myocardial cells and primary murine myocardiocytes from OGD/re-oxygenation. Reversely, Akt inhibitor MK-2206 or Akt1 shRNA knockdown almost completely abolished SC79-mediated myocardial cytoprotection. SC79 treatment in H9c2 cells inhibited OGD/re-oxygenation-induced programmed necrosis pathway, evidenced by mitochondrial depolarization and cyclophilin D-p53-ANT-1 (adenine nucleotide translocator 1) association. Further, SC79 activated Akt downstream NF-E2-related factor 2 (NRF2) signaling to suppress OGD/re-oxygenation-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Reversely, NRF2 shRNA knockdown in H9c2 cells largely attenuated SC79-induced ROS scavenging ability and cytoprotection against OGD/re-oxygenation. Together, we conclude that activation of Akt by SC79 protects myocardial cells from OGD/re-oxygenation.",

        "Abstract": "The non-cancerous functions of Akt in the airway are understudied. In some tissues, Akt phosphorylates and activates endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) to produce nitric oxide (NO) that has anti-inflammatory effects. NO production has antibacterial and antiviral effects in the airway, and increasing NO may be a useful anti-pathogen strategy. Akt also stimulates the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2) transcription factor, which transcribes antioxidant genes. Therefore, we hypothesized that activation of the Akt/eNOS pathway, which also activates Nrf-2, may have protective effects in human airway cells against injury.",

        "Abstract": "Floridoside is a low-molecular-weight organic compound, which can be accumulated by red algae under stressful conditions to protect cells via its excellent antioxidant properties. In the present study, we investigated the antioxidant mechanism of floridoside toward human hepatocyte L-02 cells. We found that floridoside had no toxicity to L-02 cells, and no reactive oxidative species were induced by it either. However, the expression of hemoxygenase-1 (HO-1) protein was up-regulated upon exposure to floridoside, and two antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and GSH-Px, were activated by floridoside. Moreover, we investigated the pathway involved in the production of these antioxidants, p38/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) MAPK-nuclear factor-erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway. ERK1/2 and p38 phosphorylation, nuclear translocation of Nrf2, and activation of ARE luciferase activity were observed upon exposure to floridoside. siRNA interference and inhibitor treatment suppressed the HO-1 expression and the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38, respectively.

        "Abstract": "Several recently published studies have suggested that decreasing VEGF levels result in placental oxidative stress in preeclampsia, although the question as to how decreased VEGF concentrations increase oxidative stress still remains unanswered. Here, we show that VEGF activated Nrf2, the main regulating factor of the intracellular redox balance, in the cytotrophic cell line BeWo. In turn, this activated the production of antioxidative enzymes thioredoxin, thioredoxin reductase, and heme oxygenase-1, which showed a decrease in their expression in the placentas of preeclamptic women. Nevertheless, this activation occurred without oxidative stress stimulus. As a consequence, the activation of Nrf2 protected BeWo cells against H(2)O(2)/Fe(2+)-induced oxidative damage. We further show that VEGF up-regulated the expression of itself. A positive feedback loop was described in which VEGF activated Nrf2 in an ERK1/2-dependent manner; the up-regulation of HO-1 expression by Nrf2 augmented the production of carbon monoxide, which in turn up-regulated VEGF expression. In conclusion, VEGF induces the Nrf2 pathway to protect against oxidative stress and, via a positive feedback loop, to elevate VEGF expression. Therefore, decreased VEGF bioavailability during preeclampsia may result in higher vulnerability to placental oxidative cell damage and a further reduction of VEGF bioavailability, a vicious circle that may end up in preeclampsia.",

        "Abstract": "Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) plays critical roles in glutathione homeostasis and metabolism. Rat GGT is a single-copy gene from which seven types of GGT mRNA with a common protein encoding sequence, but different 5'-untranslated regions, may be transcribed. We previously showed that type V-2 was the predominant form of GGT mRNA in rat L2 epithelial cells, and that it could be induced by 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) through the electrophile response element (EpRE) located in GGT promoter 5 (GP5). Here, we report transcription factors binding to GP5 EpRE and the involved signaling pathways. Immunodepletion gel shift assays demonstrated that GP5 EpRE bound JunB, c-Jun, FosB, and Fra2 from unstimulated cells, and that after exposure to HNE, EpRE binding complexes contained nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf) 1, Nrf2, JunB, c-Jun, FosB, c-Fos, Fra1, and Fra2. HNE-induced binding of Nrf2 and c-Jun in GP5 EpRE was confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Using reporter assays and specific inhibitors, we found that HNE induction of rat GGT mRNA V-2 was dependent on activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), but not protein kinase C or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Pretreatment with ERK and p38MAPK inhibitors also blocked HNE-increased EpRE binding. HNE-increased nuclear content of Nrf1, Nrf2, and c-Jun in L2 cells was partially blocked by inhibition of either ERK1/2 or p38MAPK and completely blocked by simultaneous inhibition of both MAPKs. In conclusion, HNE induces GGT mRNA V-2 through altered EpRE transcription factor binding mediated by both ERK and p38MAPK.",
