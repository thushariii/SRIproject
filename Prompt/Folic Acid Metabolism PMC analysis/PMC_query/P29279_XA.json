        "Abstract": "Wharton's jelly-derived mesenchymal stem cells (WJ-MSCs) are a novel and promising strategy for tissue engineering because of their ability to differentiate into many cell types. We characterized the differentiation of WJ-MSCs into endometrial epithelial cell (EEC)-like and endometrial stromal cell (ESC)-like cells and assessed the effect of 17β-estradiol and 8-Br-cAMP on the differentiation system.",

        "Abstract": "The initiation and progression of heart failure is linked to adverse cardiac remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM) during disease mainly through the deregulation of myocardial metalloproteinases (MMPs). Relaxin (RLX), a peptide hormone acting as a physiological cardiac effector, is a key regulator of ECM remodeling in reproductive and nonreproductive tissues. Studying primary cultures of mouse cardiac muscle cells and rat H9c2 cardiomyoblasts, we have obtained evidence for a new signaling pathway activated by RLX to induce ECM remodeling that involves the bioactive sphingolipids sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and ceramide. In both cell populations, recombinant human RLX increased sphingosine kinase activity and S1P formation, whereas sphingomyelin and ceramide content were decreased in [(3)H]serine-labeled cells. According to the literature, RLX promoted MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression/release. Pharmacological inhibition of sphingolipid metabolism and silencing of sphingosine kinase 1, the enzyme responsible for S1P formation, were able to prevent MMP expression/release elicited by the hormone and induce the expression of tissue inhibitor of MMPs. In addition, we found that sphingolipid signaling is required for the regulation of connective tissue growth factor, a member of the CCN 1-3 family of genes that are involved in cell proliferation and differentiation. Finally, the induction of cardiomyoblast maturation induced by RLX was also found to be counteracted by inhibition of S1P formation. In conclusion, these findings provide a novel mechanism by which RLX acts on cardiac ECM remodeling and cardiac cell differentiation and offer interesting therapeutic options to prevent heart fibrosis and to favor myocardial regeneration.",

        "Abstract": "Heterozygous variants in MAP3K7, encoding the transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), are associated with the ultrarare cardiospondylocarpofacial syndrome (CSCFS). Specific gain-of-function variants in the same gene cause the allelic frontometaphyseal dysplasia type 2. Phenotypic series of frontometaphyseal dysplasia also comprise variants in FLNA (type 1) and two patients with a heterozygous variant in TAB2 (type 3). We report on a 7-year-old girl with CSCFS due to the novel heterozygous c.737-7A>G variant in MAP3K7. The identified variant generates a new splice acceptor site causing an in-frame insertion of 2 amino acid residues (p.Asn245_Gly246insValVal), as demonstrated by RNA study. The patient was originally ascertained for a presumed hereditary connective tissue disorder due to soft/dystrophic skin, extreme joint hypermobility, polyvalvular heart disease, and upper gastrointestinal dismotility. Our study confirms locus homogeneity for CSCFS, expands the mutational spectrum of MAP3K7, and adds data on the existence of a community of connective tissue disorders caused by abnormalities of the TAK1-dependent signaling pathway.",
