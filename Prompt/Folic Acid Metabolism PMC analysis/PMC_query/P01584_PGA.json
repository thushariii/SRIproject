        "Abstract": "This study demonstrates how exposure to psychosocial crowding stress (CS) for 3, 7, and 14 days affects glutamate synapse functioning and signal transduction in the frontal cortex (FC) of rats. CS effects on synaptic activity were evaluated in FC slices of the primary motor cortex (M1) by measuring field potential (FP) amplitude, paired-pulse ratio (PPR), and long-term potentiation (LTP). Protein expression of GluA1, GluN2B mGluR1a/5, VGLUT1, and VGLUT2 was assessed in FC by western blot. The body's response to CS was evaluated by measuring body weight and the plasma level of plasma corticosterone (CORT), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and interleukin 1 beta (IL1B). CS 3 14d increased FP and attenuated LTP in M1, while PPR was augmented in CS 14d. The expression of GluA1, GluN2B, and mGluR1a/5 was up-regulated in CS 3d and downregulated in CS 14d. VGLUTs expression tended to increase in CS 7d. The failure to blunt the effects of chronic CS on FP and LTP in M1 suggests the impairment of habituation mechanisms by psychosocial stressors. PPR augmented by chronic CS with increased VGLUTs level in the CS 7d indicates that prolonged CS exposure changed presynaptic signaling within the FC. The CS bidirectional profile of changes in glutamate receptors' expression seems to be a common mechanism evoked by stress in the FC.",
