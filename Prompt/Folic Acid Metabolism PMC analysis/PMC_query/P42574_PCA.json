It is well documented that the lumbar spinal motoneurons of the chick embryo undergo a period of naturally occurring programmed cell death (PCD) requiring new gene expression and activation of caspases. To identify genes that exhibit changed expression levels in dying motoneurons, we used a PCR-based subtractive hybridization protocol to identify messages uniquely expressed in motoneurons deprived of trophic support as compared with their healthy counterparts. We report that one upregulated message in developing motoneurons undergoing cell death is the mRNA for amyloid precursor protein (APP). Increased levels of APP and beta-amyloid protein are also detected within dying motoneurons. The predicted peptide sequence of APP indicates two potential cleavage sites for caspase-3 (CPP-32), a caspase activated in dying motoneurons. When peptide inhibitors of caspase-3 are administered to motoneurons destined to undergo PCD, decreased levels of APP protein and greatly reduced beta-amyloid production are observed. Furthermore, we show that APP is cleaved by caspase-3. Our results suggest that differential gene expression results in increased levels of APP, providing a potential substrate for one of the cell death-activated caspases that may ultimately cause the demise of the cell. These results, combined with information on the toxic role of APP and its proteolytic by-product beta-amyloid, in the neurodegenerative disease Alzheimer's, suggest that events of developmental PCD may be reactivated in early stages of pathological neurodegeneration.",

        "Abstract": "Diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2) catalyzes the final step of triglyceride (TG) synthesis. DGAT2 deletion in mice lowers liver TGs, and DGAT2 inhibitors are under investigation for the treatment of fatty liver disease. Here, we show that DGAT2 inhibition also suppressed SREBP-1 cleavage, reduced fatty acid synthesis, and lowered TG accumulation and secretion from liver. DGAT2 inhibition increased phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) levels in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and inhibited SREBP-1 cleavage, while DGAT2 overexpression lowered ER PE concentrations and increased SREBP-1 cleavage in vivo. ER enrichment with PE blocked SREBP-1 cleavage independent of Insigs, which are ER proteins that normally retain SREBPs in the ER. Thus, inhibition of DGAT2 shunted diacylglycerol into phospholipid synthesis, increasing the PE content of the ER, resulting in reduced SREBP-1 cleavage and less hepatic steatosis. This study reveals a new mechanism that regulates SREBP-1 activation and lipogenesis that is independent of sterols and SREBP-2 in liver.",

        "Abstract": "The mechanisms by which immature thymocyte apoptosis is induced during negative selection are poorly defined. Reports demonstrated that cross-linking of T-cell receptor leads to stromal cell activation, expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and, subsequently, to thymocyte apoptosis. Therefore we examined, whether NO directly or indirectly, through peroxynitrite formation, causes thymocyte apoptosis. Immuno-histochemical detection of nitrotyrosine revealed in vivo peroxynitrite formation in the thymi of naive mice. Nitrotyrosine, the footprint of peroxynitrite, was predominantly found in the corticomedullary junction and the medulla of naive mice. In the thymi of mice deficient in the inducible isoform of nitric oxide synthase, considerably less nitrotyrosine was found. Exposure of thymocytes in vitro to low concentrations (10 microM) of peroxynitrite led to apoptosis, whereas higher concentrations (50 microM) resulted in intense cell death with the characteristics of necrosis. We also investigated the effect of poly (ADP-ribose) synthetase (PARS) inhibition on thymocyte apoptosis. Using the PARS inhibitor 3-aminobenzamide (3-AB), or thymocytes from PARS-deficient animals, we established that PARS determines the fate of thymocyte death. Suppression of cellular ATP levels, and the cellular necrosis in response to peroxynitrite were prevented by PARS inhibition. Therefore, in the absence of PARS, cells are diverted towards the pathway of apoptotic cell death. Similar results were obtained with H2O2 treatment, while apoptosis induced by non-oxidative stimuli such as dexamethasone or anti-FAS antibody was unaffected by PARS inhibition. In conclusion, we propose that peroxynitrite-induced apoptosis may play a role in the process of thymocyte negative selection. Furthermore, we propose that the physiological role of PARS cleavage by apopain during apoptosis may serve as an energy-conserving step, enabling the cell to complete the process of apoptosis.",

To identify the genes under the control of PrtR and elucidate its regulatory mechanism in A. oryzae, prtR gene disruption mutants were generated. The control strain clearly showed a halo on media containing skim milk as the nitrogen source, whereas the ΔprtR strain formed a smaller halo. Measurement of acid peptidase activity revealed that approximately 84% of acidic endopeptidase and 86% of carboxypeptidase activities are positively regulated by PrtR.

        "Abstract": "ING5 can interact with p53, thereby inhibiting cell growth and inducing apoptosis. We found that ING5 overexpression not only inhibited proliferation, migration, and invasion, but also induced G2 arrest, differentiation, autophagy, apoptosis, glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration in lung cancer cells. ING5 transfection up-regulated the expression of Cdc2, ATG13, ATG14, Beclin-1, LC-3B, AIF, cytochrome c, Akt1/2/3, ADFP, PFK-1 and PDPc, while down-regulated the expression of Bcl-2, XIAP, survivin,β-catenin and HXK1. ING5 transfection desensitized cells to the chemotherapy of MG132, paclitaxel, and SAHA, which paralleled with apoptotic alteration. ING5 overexpression suppressed the xenograft tumor growth by inhibiting proliferation and inducing apoptosis. ING5 expression level was significantly higher in normal tissue than that in lung cancer at both protein and mRNA levels. Nuclear ING5 expression was positively correlated with ki-67 expression and cytoplasmic ING5 expression. Cytoplasmic ING5 expression was positively associated with lymph node metastasis, and negatively with age, lymphatic invasion or CPP32 expression. ING5 expression was different in histological classification: squamous cell carcinoma > adenocarcinoma > large cell carcinoma > small cell carcinoma. Taken together, our data suggested that ING5 downregulation might involved in carcinogenesis, growth, and invasion of lung cancer and could be considered as a promising marker to gauge the aggressiveness of lung cancer. It might be employed as a potential target for gene therapy of lung cancer.",
