        "Abstract": "Canonical NF-κB signaling through the inhibitor of κB kinase (IKK) complex requires induction of IKK2/IKKβ subunit catalytic activity via specific phosphorylation within its activation loop. This process is known to be dependent upon the accessory ubiquitin (Ub)-binding subunit NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO)/IKKγ as well as poly-Ub chains. However, the mechanism through which poly-Ub binding serves to promote IKK catalytic activity is unclear. Here, we show that binding of NEMO/IKKγ to linear poly-Ub promotes a second interaction between NEMO/IKKγ and IKK2/IKKβ, distinct from the well-characterized interaction of the NEMO/IKKγ N terminus to the \"NEMO-binding domain\" at the C terminus of IKK2/IKKβ. We mapped the location of this second interaction to a stretch of roughly six amino acids immediately N-terminal to the zinc finger domain in human NEMO/IKKγ. We also showed that amino acid residues within this region of NEMO/IKKγ are necessary for binding to IKK2/IKKβ through this secondary interaction in vitro and for full activation of IKK2/IKKβ in cultured cells. Furthermore, we identified a docking site for this segment of NEMO/IKKγ on IKK2/IKKβ within its scaffold-dimerization domain proximal to the kinase domain-Ub-like domain. Finally, we showed that a peptide derived from this region of NEMO/IKKγ is capable of interfering specifically with canonical NF-κB signaling in transfected cells. These in vitro biochemical and cell culture-based experiments suggest that, as a consequence of its association with linear poly-Ub, NEMO/IKKγ plays a direct role in priming IKK2/IKKβ for phosphorylation and that this process can be inhibited to specifically disrupt canonical NF-κB signaling.",

        "Abstract": "GP-2250, a novel anticancer agent, severely limits the energy metabolism, as demonstrated by the inhibition of hexokinase 2 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and a decrease of ATP. Rescue experiments with supplementary pyruvate or oxaloacetate demonstrated that a TCA cycle deficit largely contributed to cytotoxicity. Activation of the energy-deficit sensor, AMP-dependent protein kinase, was associated with increased phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and Raptor, pointing to a possible deficit in the synthesis of fatty acids and proteins as essential cell components. Binding of p65 to DNA was dose-dependently reduced in nuclear lysates. A transcriptional deficit of NF-κB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) was substantiated by the downregulation of cyclin D1 and of the anti-apoptotic Bcl2, in line with reduction in tumour cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis, respectively. The upregulation of p53 concomitant with an excess of ROS supported apoptosis. Thus, the anticancer activity of GP-2250 is a result of disruption of energy metabolism and inhibition of tumour promotion by NF-κB.",

The exclusive proprietary Chinese medicine Ganweikang (GWK) tablet has been marketed for years in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B (CHB). However, the pharmacodynamic material basis and underlying mechanism of GWK are not completely clear. This study is aimed at investigating the pharmacological mechanism of the GWK tablet in the treatment of CHB. The chemical ingredient information was obtained from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Database and Analysis Platform (TCMSP), Traditional Chinese Medicines Integrated Database (TCMID), and Shanghai Institute of Organic Chemistry of CAS. Ingredients and disease-related targets were defined by a combination of differentially expressed genes from CHB transcriptome data and open-source databases. Target-pathway-target (TPT) network analysis, molecular docking, and chemical composition analysis were adopted to further verify the key targets and corresponding active ingredients of GWK. Eight herbs of GWK were correlated to 330 compounds with positive oral bioavailability, and 199 correlated targets were identified. The TPT network was constructed based on the 146 enriched targets by KEGG pathway analysis, significantly associated with 95 pathways. Twenty-five nonvolatile components and 25 volatile components in GWK were identified in UPLC-QTOF/MS and GC-MS chromatograms. The key active ingredients of GWK include ferulic acid, oleanolic acid, ursolic acid, tormentic acid, 11-deoxyglycyrrhetic acid, dibenzoyl methane, anisaldehyde, wogonin, protocatechuic acid, psoralen, caffeate, dimethylcaffeic acid, vanillin,",

        "Abstract": "The hepatitis B virus (HBV) is one of the major viral infection problems worldwide in public health. The exclusive proprietary Chinese medicine Ganweikang (GWK) tablet has been marketed for years in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B (CHB). However, the pharmacodynamic material basis and underlying mechanism of GWK are not completely clear. This study is aimed at investigating the pharmacological mechanism of the GWK tablet in the treatment of CHB. The chemical ingredient information was obtained from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Database and Analysis Platform (TCMSP), Traditional Chinese Medicines Integrated Database (TCMID), and Shanghai Institute of Organic Chemistry of CAS. Ingredients and disease-related targets were defined by a combination of differentially expressed genes from CHB transcriptome data and open-source databases. Target-pathway-target (TPT) network analysis, molecular docking, and chemical composition analysis were adopted to further verify the key targets and corresponding active ingredients of GWK. Eight herbs of GWK were correlated to 330 compounds with positive oral bioavailability, and 199 correlated targets were identified. The TPT network was constructed based on the 146 enriched targets by KEGG pathway analysis, significantly associated with 95 pathways. Twenty-five nonvolatile components and 25 volatile components in GWK were identified in UPLC-QTOF/MS and GC-MS chromatograms. The key active ingredients of GWK include ferulic acid, oleanolic acid, ursolic acid, tormentic acid, 11-deoxyglycyrrhetic acid, dibenzoyl methane, anisaldehyde, wogonin, protocatechuic acid, psoralen, caffeate, dimethylcaffeic acid, vanillin,",
