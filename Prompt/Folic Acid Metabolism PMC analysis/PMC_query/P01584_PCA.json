        "Abstract": "Background A decline in bone mineral density is a defining feature of osteoporosis, which is a prevalent bone complication associated with diabetes. This study aims to shed light on the protective effect of Zamzam water (ZW), a famous alkaline water, on diabetes-induced osteoporosis. Methodology Of a total of 40 male rats, 10 male rats each were divided into the following four groups: group I (normal control rats), group II (ZW group), group III (diabetic rats), and group IV (DM + ZW). Anteroposterior and lateral X-rays were taken of the rats in each group before the end of the experiment. The study assessed serum levels of inflammatory markers including interleukin 6, interleukin-1 beta, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha; bone formation markers including osteocalcin (OC); alkaline phosphatase (ALP); and bone resorption markers including the N-terminal telopeptide of collagen type I (NTX-1), bone deoxypyridinoline (DPD), and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b (TRAP-5b). Results Rats with diabetes who consumed ZW exhibited a significant (p < 0.001) increase in OC and ALP bone formation markers and a decrease in NTX-1, DPD, and TRAP-5b bone resorption markers, with improvements in the X-ray image of the vertebral column at the L6 vertebra level. Conclusions ZW improved diabetes-induced osteoporosis in rats by enhancing osteoblastic activity and downregulating osteoclastic activity.",

A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis highlighted TNF, IL1B, IL6, ESR1, PPARG, NFKB1, STAT3 and TLR4 as key targets of GA against acne, which is further verified by molecular docking. The experimental results showed that GA inhibited lipid synthesis in vitro and in vivo, improved the histopathological damage of skin, prevented mast cell infiltration and decreased the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6.

One hundred eighty 21-day-old pigs (5.17 ± 0.57 kg) were assigned in a randomized block design to 1 of 4 dietary treatments: (1) CON: control, basal diet, (2) NUC: CON + nucleotides, (3) YSC: CON + lysed yeast S. cerevisiae, (4) ASB: CON + acidifier sodium butyrate. Pigs were fed for 24 days, phase 1 (21-32 days) and 2 (32-45 days). During phase 1, YSC and ASB improved average daily gain (ADG) and feed conversion (FC) compared with CON. At the overall period, ASB improved ADG and YSC improved FC compared with CON. The NUC diet did not affect growth performance. The ASB increased ileal villus height compared to CON. The YSC and ASB reduced the number of Peyer's patches in the ileum compared with CON. The YSC increased mRNA expression of nutrient transporters (SMCT2, MCT1, and PepT1), tight junction proteins (OCL and ZO-1), antioxidants (GPX), and IL1-β in the jejunum compared with CON. The ASB increased mRNA expression of nutrient transporters (SGLT1 and MCT1), tight junction proteins (OCL and ZO-1), and antioxidants (GPX and SOD) compared with CON. In conclusion, autolyzed yeast and sodium butyrate promoted growth performance by improving the integrity of the intestinal barrier, the mRNA expression of nutrient transporters, and antioxidant enzymes in the jejunum of nursery pigs whereas supplementation of nucleotides did not show such effects.",

        "Abstract": "Background A decline in bone mineral density is a defining feature of osteoporosis, which is a prevalent bone complication associated with diabetes. This study aims to shed light on the protective effect of Zamzam water (ZW), a famous alkaline water, on diabetes-induced osteoporosis. Methodology Of a total of 40 male rats, 10 male rats each were divided into the following four groups: group I (normal control rats), group II (ZW group), group III (diabetic rats), and group IV (DM + ZW). Anteroposterior and lateral X-rays were taken of the rats in each group before the end of the experiment. The study assessed serum levels of inflammatory markers including interleukin 6, interleukin-1 beta, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha; bone formation markers including osteocalcin (OC); alkaline phosphatase (ALP); and bone resorption markers including the N-terminal telopeptide of collagen type I (NTX-1), bone deoxypyridinoline (DPD), and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b (TRAP-5b). Results Rats with diabetes who consumed ZW exhibited a significant (p < 0.001) increase in OC and ALP bone formation markers and a decrease in NTX-1, DPD, and TRAP-5b bone resorption markers, with improvements in the X-ray image of the vertebral column at the L6 vertebra level. Conclusions ZW improved diabetes-induced osteoporosis in rats by enhancing osteoblastic activity and downregulating osteoclastic activity.",

        "Abstract": "IL-1 family ligand does not possess a typical hydrophobic signal peptide and needs a processing enzyme for maturation. The maturation process of IL-33 (IL-1F11), a new member of the IL-1 family ligand, remains unclear. Precursor IL-33 ligand affinity column isolates neutrophil proteinase 3 (PR3) from human urinary proteins. PR3 is a known IL-1 family ligand-processing enzyme for IL-1β (IL-1F2) and IL-18 (IL-1F4), including other inflammatory cytokines. We investigated PR3 in the maturation process of precursor IL-33 because we isolated urinary PR3 by using the precursor IL-33 ligand affinity column. PR3 converted inactive human and mouse precursor IL-33 proteins to biological active forms; however, the increase of PR3 incubation time abrogated IL-33 activities. Unlike caspase-1-cleaved precursor IL-18, PR3 cut precursor IL-33 and IL-18 at various sites and yielded multibands. The increased incubation period of PR3 abated mature IL-33 in a time-dependent manner. The result is consistent with the decreased bioactivity of IL-33 along with the increased PR3 incubation time. Six different human and mouse recombinant IL-33 proteins were expressed by the predicted consensus amino acid sequence of PR3 cleavage sites and tested for bioactivities. The human IL-33/p1 was highly active, but human IL-33/p2 and p3 proteins were inactive. Our results suggest the dual functions (activation/termination) of PR3 in IL-33 biological activity.",
