        "Abstract": "In hypertonic environment, taurine accumulates in cells via activation of TauT (taurine transporter) as an adaptive regulation. Recent studies revealed that TonE (tonicity-responsive element)/TonEBP (TonE-binding protein) pathway regulated the expression of various molecules which protect cells against hypertonic stress. In the present study, we investigated the osmoregulatory mechanisms of TauT expression. TauT was up-regulated at both functional and transcriptional levels in HepG2 under hypertonic condition. The TonE site was identified in the promoter region of TauT gene. Reporter gene assay revealed that promoter activity was increased under hypertonic conditions, whereas deletion or mutation of TonE sequence abolished the induction of the promoter activity in response to hypertonicity. By using the reporter gene plasmids containing a TonE site of TauT promoter (p2xTonE-Luc), it was demonstrated that a TonE site was sufficient for the hypertonicity-mediated activation of TauT promoter. Importantly, co-transfection of TauT promoter gene plasmid with wild-type TonEBP expression vector enhanced promoter activity under isotonic conditions, whereas dominant-negative TonEBP abrogated the TauT promoter activity induced by hypertonicity. Finally, treatment with taurine prevented HepG2 cells from cell death induced by hypertonic medium. These findings suggested that induction of TauT by hypertonicity is mediated by the activation of the TonE/TonEBP pathway and confers resistance to hypertonic stress.",

        "Abstract": "Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) is an enzyme that plays a key role in intracellular immune response against respiratory infections. Since various species of nonhuman primates exhibit different levels of susceptibility to infectious respiratory diseases, and since variation in regulatory regions of genes is thought to play a key role in expression levels of genes, two candidate regulatory regions of iNOS were mapped, sequenced, and compared across five species of nonhuman primates: African green monkeys (Chlorocebus sabaeus), pig-tailed macaques (Macaca nemestrina), cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis), Indian rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta), and Chinese rhesus macaques (M. mulatta). In addition, we conducted an in silico analysis of the transcription factor binding sites associated with genetic variation in these two candidate regulatory regions across species. We found that only one of the two candidate regions showed strong evidence of involvement in iNOS regulation. Specifically, we found evidence of 13 conserved binding site candidates linked to iNOS regulation: AP-1, C/EBPB, CREB, GATA-1, GATA-3, NF-AT, NF-AT5, NF-κB, KLF4, Oct-1, PEA3, SMAD3, and TCF11. Additionally, we found evidence of interspecies variation in binding sites for several regulatory elements linked to iNOS (GATA-3, GATA-4, KLF6, SRF, STAT-1, STAT-3, OLF-1 and HIF-1) across species, especially in African green monkeys relative to other species. Given the key role of iNOS in respiratory immune response, the findings of this study might help guide the direction of future studies aimed to uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying the increased susceptibility of African green monkeys to several viral and bacterial respiratory infections.",

        "Abstract": "The transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T cell 5 (NFAT5) is activated by the stress of hypertonicity (e.g., high NaCl). Increased expression of NFAT5 target genes causes accumulation of protective organic osmolytes and heat shock proteins. Under normotonic conditions (∼300 mosmol/kgH(2)O), NFAT5 is distributed between the nucleus and cytoplasm, hypertonicity causes it to translocate into the nucleus, and hypotonicity causes it to translocate into the cytoplasm. The mechanism of translocation is complex and not completely understood. NFAT5-T298 is a known contact site of NFAT5 with its specific DNA element [osmotic response element (ORE)]. In the present study, we find that mutation of NFAT5-T298 to alanine or aspartic acid not only reduces binding of NFAT5 to OREs (EMSA) but also proportionately reduces high NaCl-induced nuclear translocation of NFAT5. Combined mutation of other NFAT5 DNA contact sites (R293A/E299A/R302A) also greatly reduces both specific DNA binding and nuclear localization of NFAT5. NFAT5-T298 is a potential phosphorylation site, but, using protein mass spectrometry, we do not find phosphorylation at NFAT5-T298. Further, decreased high NaCl-induced nuclear localization of NFAT5 mutated at T298 does not involve previously known regulatory mechanisms, including hypotonicity-induced export of NFAT5, regulated by phosphorylation of NFAT5-S155, XPO1 (CRM1/exportin1)-mediated export of NFAT5 from the nucleus, or hypertonicity-induced elevation of NUP88, which enhances nuclear localization of NFAT5. We conclude that specific DNA binding of NFAT5 contributes to its nuclear localization, by mechanisms, as yet undetermined, but independent of ones previously described to regulate NFAT5 distribution.",
