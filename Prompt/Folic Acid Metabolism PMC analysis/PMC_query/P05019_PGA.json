However, this approach lacks cell-specific resolution. We performed comprehensive transcriptomic analyses on bulk tissue and laser-capture microdissected (LCM) neurons from 59 postmortem human brains (27 ASD and 32 controls) in the superior temporal gyrus (STG) of individuals ranging from 2 to 73 years of age. In bulk tissue, synaptic signaling, heat shock protein-related pathways, and RNA splicing were significantly altered in ASD.

        "Abstract": "This study was designed to investigate a possible role of the N-terminal tripeptide of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-I), Gly-Pro-Glu (GPE), physiologically generated in neurons following IGF-I-specific cleavage, in promoting neural regeneration after an injury. Primary cultures of mouse neural stem cells (NSCs), obtained from 13.5 Days post-conception (dpc) mouse embryos, were challenged with either GPE, growth hormone (GH), or GPE + GH and the effects on cell proliferation, migration, and survival were evaluated both under basal conditions and in response to a wound healing assay. The cellular pathways activated by GPE were also investigated by using specific chemical inhibitors. The results of the study indicate that GPE treatment promotes the proliferation and the migration of neural stem cells in vitro through a mechanism that involves the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase PI3K-Akt pathways. Intriguingly, both GPE effects and the signaling pathways activated were similar to those observed after GH treatment. Based upon the results obtained from this study, GPE, as well as GH, may be useful in promoting neural protection and/or regeneration after an injury.",

        "Abstract": "Glutamate acts as the universal agonist at ionotropic glutamate receptors in part because of its high degree of conformational flexibility. Other amino acids and small peptides, however, can activate N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, albeit usually with lower affinity and efficacy. Here, we examined the action of glycine-proline-glutamate (GPE), a naturally occurring tripeptide formed in the brain following cleavage of IGF-I. GPE is thought to have biological activity in the brain, but its mechanism of action remains unclear. With its flanking glutamate and glycine residues, GPE could bind to either the agonist or coagonist sites on NMDA receptors, however, this has not been directly tested. Using whole cell patch-clamp recordings in combination with rapid solution exchange, we examined both steady-state currents induced by GPE as well as the effects of GPE on synaptically evoked currents. High concentrations of GPE evoked inward currents, which were blocked either by NMDA receptor competitive antagonists or the voltage-dependent channel blocker Mg(2+). GPE also produced a slight attenuation in the NMDA- and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents without altering the paired-pulse ratio. Our results suggest that GPE can activate NMDA receptors but at concentrations well above the expected concentration of GPE in the brain. Therefore, it is unlikely that endogenous GPE interacts with glutamate receptors under normal conditions.",

However, the phosphorylation sites of IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) affected by glutamate remain to be elucidated, and importantly, which subtype of NMDARs plays a major role in attenuating the prosurvival effect of IGF-1 is still unknown. In the present study, glutamate was found to attenuate the tyrosine phosphorylation of the IGF-1R and the prosurvival effect of IGF-1 in primary cultured cortical neurons. NMDAR inhibitors, MK801 and AP-5, blocked the inhibitory effect of glutamate on the phosphorylation of IGF-1R and increased cell survival, while DNQX, LY341495, and CPCCOEt had no effect. Interestingly, we found that glutamate decreased the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues 1131, 1135/1136, 1250/1251, and 1316, while it had no effect on tyrosine 950 in cortical neurons. Moreover, using specific antagonists and siRNA to downregulate individual NMDAR subunits, we found that the activation of NR2B-containing NMDARs was essential for glutamate to inhibit IGF-1 signaling.

        "Abstract": "Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is), such as empagliflozin, lower blood glucose in type 2 diabetes mellitus and improve cardiorenal outcomes regardless of diabetes presence. Whether SGLT2is exert any effects on the brain's metabolism has not been studied. We conducted a single-arm clinical trial to investigate the effects of once daily administration of oral empagliflozin (25 mg) for 14 days on systemic and brain metabolism in 21 non-diabetics aged 55 years old or older. Empagliflozin lowered circulating insulin and elevated β-hydroxybutyrate over 34-h periods, both following its first administration and after 14 days of daily administration, with minor alterations in glucose homeostasis. Levels of phosphorylated insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (pIGF-1R), phosphorylated insulin receptor (pIR), phosphorylated-in-tyrosine insulin receptor substrate-1 (pY-IRS-1), and phosphorylated protein kinase B or AKT (pAKT) were increased in extracellular vesicles enriched for neuronal origin (NEVs) following the first empagliflozin administration, but not after 14 days. Our finding of IGF-1R upregulation in NEVs is promising because several post-mortem and epidemiological studies support the idea that upregulation of IGF signaling may protect against Alzheimer's disease (AD). Moreover, our finding showing activation of insulin signaling and, in particular, the canonical pathway (pIR, pY-IRS-1, pAKT) in NEVs is important because such changes have been repeatedly associated with neuronal survival. Using brain magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), we detected decreased concentrations of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate and its precursor glutamine after empagliflozin administration. This finding is also encouraging since glutamatergic excitotoxicity has long been implicated in AD pathology. Overall, our findings may motivate the repurposing of SGLT2is for use in AD and other, related diseases that are characterized by downregulation of IGF-1/insulin signaling in neurons and excitotoxicity.",

        "Abstract": "Animals use pheromones as a conspecific chemical language to respond appropriately to environmental changes. The soil nematode Caenorhabditis elegans secretes ascaroside pheromones throughout the lifecycle, which influences entry into dauer phase in early larvae, in addition to sexual attraction and aggregation. In adult hermaphrodites, pheromone sensory signals perceived by worms usually elicit repulsion as an initial behavioral signature. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying neuronal pheromone sensory process from perception to repulsion in adult hermaphrodites remain poorly understood. Here, we show that pheromone signals perceived by GPA-3 is conveyed through glutamatergic neurotransmission in which neuronal DAF-16/FoxO plays an important modulatory role by controlling glutaminase gene expression. We further provide evidence that this modulatory role for DAF-16/FoxO seems to be conserved evolutionarily by electro-physiological study in mouse primary hippocampal neurons that are responsible for glutamatergic neurotransmission. These findings provide the basis for understanding the nematode pheromone signaling, which seems crucial for adaptation of adult hermaphrodites to changes in environmental condition for survival.",

        "Abstract": "Although a higher protein intake, particularly from vegetable sources, has been shown to be associated with higher bone mineral density (BMD) the relative impact of specific amino acids on BMD and risk of osteoporosis remains to be determined. Mechanistic research suggests that a number of specific amino acids, including five nonessential amino acids--alanine, arginine, glutamic acid, glycine, and proline--may play a role in bone health, principally through improved production of insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 and the synthesis of collagen and muscle protein. However to date, no previous studies have examined the associations between habitual intake of amino acids and direct measures of BMD and prevalence of osteoporosis or osteopenia, and no studies have examined this relationship in discordant identical twin-pairs. In these analyses of female monozygotic twin-pairs discordant for amino acid intake (n = 135), twins with higher intakes of alanine and glycine had significantly higher BMD at the spine than their co-twins with within-pair differences in spine-BMD of 0.012 g/cm(2) (SE 0.01; p = 0.039) and 0.014 g/cm(2) (SE 0.01; p = 0.026), respectively. Furthermore, in cross-sectional multivariable analyses of 3160 females aged 18 to 79 years, a higher intake of total protein was significantly associated with higher DXA-measured BMD at the spine (quartile Q4 to quartile Q1: 0.017 g/cm(2), SE 0.01, p = 0.035) and forearm (Q4 to Q1: 0.010 g/cm(2), SE 0.003, p = 0.002). Intake of six amino acids (alanine, arginine, glutamic acid, leucine, lysine, and proline) were associated with higher BMD at the spine and forearm with the strongest association observed for leucine (Q4 to Q1: 0.024 g/cm(2), SE 0.01, p = 0.007). When intakes were stratified by protein source, vegetable or animal, prevalence of osteoporosis or osteopenia was 13% to 19% lower comparing extreme quartiles of vegetable intake for five amino acids (not glutamic acid or proline). These data provide evidence to suggest that intake of protein and several amino acids, including alanine and glycine, may be beneficial for bone health, independent of genetic background.",
