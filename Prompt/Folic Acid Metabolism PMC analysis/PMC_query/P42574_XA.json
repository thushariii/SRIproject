        "Abstract": "Activated microglia may be detrimental to neuronal survival in a number of neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, strategies that reduce microglial neurotoxicity may have therapeutic benefit. Stimulation of group II metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors on rat primary microglia with the specific group II agonist 2S,2'R,3'R-2-(2',3'-dicarboxy-cyclopropyl)glycine for 24 h induced microglial activation and resulted in a neurotoxic microglial phenotype. These effects were attributable to preferential mGlu2 stimulation, because N-acetyl-L-aspartyl-L-glutamate, a specific mGlu3 agonist, did not induce microglial activation or neurotoxicity. Stimulation of microglial mGlu2 but not mGlu3 induced caspase-3 activation in cerebellar granule neurons in culture, using microglial-conditioned media as well as cocultures. Stimulation of microglial mGlu2 induced tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) release, which contributed to microglial neurotoxicity mediated via neuronal TNF receptor 1 and caspase-3 activation. Stimulation of microglial group I or III mGlu receptors did not induce TNFalpha release. TNFalpha was only neurotoxic in the presence of microglia or microglial-conditioned medium. The toxicity of TNFalpha could be prevented by coexposure of neurons to conditioned medium from microglia stimulated by the specific group III agonist L-2-amino-4-phosphono-butyric acid. The neurotoxicity of TNFalpha derived from mGlu2-stimulated microglia was potentiated by microglial-derived Fas ligand (FasL), the death receptor ligand. FasL was constitutively expressed in microglia and shed after mGlu2 stimulation. Our data suggest that selective and inverse modulation of microglial mGlu2 and mGlu3 may prove a therapeutic target in neuroinflammatory diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis.",

        "Abstract": "Farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs) represent a new class of anticancer drugs that show promise in blocking the growth of tumors. Here, we report that FTIs are capable of inducing apoptosis of transformed but not untransformed cells. Treatment of v-K-ras-transformed normal rat kidney (KNRK) cells with FTIs leads to the induction of apoptotic cell morphology, chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation. In addition, fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis of FTI-treated KNRK cells shows a sub-G1 apoptotic peak (chromosome content of <2 N). This FTI-induced apoptosis is evident only when the cells are grown in low serum conditions (0.1% fetal calf serum) and is observed selectively with transformed KNRK cells and not with untransformed NRK cells. Further analysis of the mechanism underlying this apoptosis has shown that FTI treatment of KNRK cells results in the activation of caspase 3 but not caspase 1. Moreover, the addition of Z-DEVD-fmk, an agent that interferes with caspase 3 activity, can inhibit FTI-induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Introduction of the CASP-3 gene into MCF7 cells, which lack caspase 3 activity, results in a significant increase of FTI-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, FTI induces the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol. This release is an important feature of caspase 3-mediated apoptosis. These results suggest that FTIs induce apoptosis through the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria resulting in caspase 3 activation.",
