        "Abstract": "In this study, we aimed to explore the clinical significance of serum CK18-M65 and CK18-M30 levels in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) complicated by nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and liver fibrosis. The observation and control groups comprised 133 patients with CHB complicated by NASH and 50 healthy patients from our hospital, respectively. Liver function indices, including alanine aminotransferase, glutamic aminotransferase, γ-glutamyltransferase, total bilirubin, total protein, and total cholesterol, were determined using an automatic biochemical analyzer. Hyaluronic acid, type III procollagen, type IV collagen, laminin, and CK18-M65 and M30 levels were detected using ELISA. Serum CK18-M65 and M30 levels in patients with CHB complicated by NASH were positively correlated with the liver fibrosis stage (P < .05). While serum CK18-M65 demonstrated a low diagnostic value for liver fibrosis in the S0-1 stage, it exhibited good diagnostic value for S2-3 stage liver fibrosis. Serum CK18-M30 displayed good diagnostic value for S0-1 and S2-3 hepatic fibrosis, particularly for S2-3 hepatic fibrosis. Elevated serum CK18-M65 and CK18-M30 levels in patients with CHB complicated with NASH suggest their potential utility in evaluating the progression of liver fibrosis in this population. In particular, CK18-M30 exhibits superior diagnostic efficiency.",

        "Abstract": "Laminin-111 protein complex links the extracellular matrix to integrin α7β1 in sarcolemma, thus replacing in dystrophic muscles links normally insured by the dystrophin complex. Laminin-111 injection in mdx mouse stabilized sarcolemma, restored serum creatine kinase to wild-type levels, and protected muscles from exercised-induced damages. These results suggested that increased laminin-111 is a potential therapy for DMD. Laminin subunit beta 1 and laminin subunit gamma 1 are expressed in adult human muscle, but laminin subunit alpha 1 (LAMA1) gene is expressed only during embryogenesis. We thus developed an alternative method to laminin-111 protein repeated administration by inducing expression of the endogenous mouse Lama1 gene. This was done with the CRSPR/Cas9 system, i.e., by targeting the Lama1 promoter with one or several gRNAs and a dCas9 coupled with the VP160 transcription activation domain. Lama1 mRNA (qRT-PCR) and proteins (immunohistochemistry and western blot) were not detected in the control C2C12 myoblasts and in control muscles. However, significant expression was observed in cells transfected and in mouse muscles electroporated with plasmids coding for dCas9-VP160 and a gRNA. Larger synergic increases were observed by using two or three gRNAs. The increased Lama1 expression did not modify the expression of the α7 and β1 integrins. Increased expression of Lama1 by the CRISPR/Cas9 system will have to be further investigated by systemic delivery of the CRISPR/Cas9 components to verify whether this could be a treatment for several myopathies.",

        "Abstract": "Laminins are major cell-adhesive proteins in basement membranes that are capable of binding to integrins. Laminins consist of three chains (alpha, beta, and gamma), in which three laminin globular modules in the alpha chain and the Glu residue in the C-terminal tail of the gamma chain have been shown to be prerequisites for binding to integrins. However, it remains unknown whether any part of the beta chain is involved in laminin-integrin interactions. We compared the binding affinities of pairs of laminin isoforms containing the beta1 or beta2 chain toward a panel of laminin-binding integrins, and we found that beta2 chain-containing laminins (beta2-laminins) bound more avidly to alpha3beta1 and alpha7X2beta1 integrins than beta1 chain-containing laminins (beta1-laminins), whereas alpha6beta1, alpha6beta4, and alpha7X1beta1 integrins did not show any preference toward beta2-laminins. Because alpha3beta1 contains the \"X2-type\" variable region in the alpha3 subunit and alpha6beta1 and alpha6beta4 contain the \"X1-type\" region in the alpha6 subunit, we hypothesized that only integrins containing the X2-type region were capable of discriminating between beta1-laminins and beta2-laminins. In support of this possibility, a putative X2-type variant of alpha6beta1 was produced and found to bind preferentially to beta2-laminins. Production of a series of swap mutants between the beta1 and beta2 chains revealed that the C-terminal 20 amino acids in the coiled-coil domain were responsible for the enhanced integrin binding by beta2-laminins. Taken together, the results provide evidence that the C-terminal region of beta chains is involved in laminin recognition by integrins and modulates the binding affinities of laminins toward X2-type integrins.",

Recent research reveals its additional role in modulating the immune system, and particularly in reducing inflammation crucial for protecting tooth-supporting tissues. Notably, monocytes and macrophages, essential cellular components overseeing various physiological and pathological processes, stand as potential mediators of lidocaine's effects. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate how lidocaine influences cell behavior using RNA sequencing. To investigate the effect of lidocaine on THP-1 cells' behavior, we performed an MTT assay and RNA-Seq along with qPCR analyses to evaluate the transcriptomic and proteomic changes in THP-1 cells. Our results showed that a high dose of lidocaine (>1 mM) had a significant cytotoxic effect on THP-1 cells. However, a lidocaine dose lower than 0.5 mM induced a mixed anti-inflammatory profile by significantly upregulating tissue remodeling (",
