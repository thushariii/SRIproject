Here we demonstrate that semaglutide improves cardiac function and reduces hypertrophy and fibrosis in a mouse model of pressure overload-induced heart failure. Semaglutide preserves mitochondrial structure and function under chronic stress. Metabolomics reveals that semaglutide reduces mitochondrial damage, lipid accumulation, and ATP deficiency by promoting pyruvate entry into the tricarboxylic acid cycle and increasing fatty acid oxidation. Transcriptional analysis shows that semaglutide regulates myocardial energy metabolism through the Creb5/NR4a1 axis in the PI3K/AKT pathway, reducing NR4a1 expression and its translocation to mitochondria.

        "Abstract": "Adipose tissue was once known as a reservoir for energy storage but is now considered a crucial organ for hormone and energy flux with important effects on health and disease. Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) is an incretin hormone secreted from the small intestinal K cells, responsible for augmenting insulin release, and has gained attention for its independent and amicable effects with glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), another incretin hormone secreted from the small intestinal L cells. The GIP receptor (GIPR) is found in whole adipose tissue, whereas the GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) is not, and some studies suggest that GIPR action lowers body weight and plays a role in lipolysis, glucose/lipid uptake/disposal, adipose tissue blood flow, lipid oxidation, and free-fatty acid (FFA) re-esterification, which may or may not be influenced by other hormones such as insulin. This review summarizes the research on the effects of GIP in adipose tissue (distinct depots of white and brown) using cellular, rodent, and human models. In doing so, we explore the mechanisms of GIPR-based medications for treating metabolic disorders, such as type 2 diabetes and obesity, and how GIPR agonism and antagonism contribute to improvements in metabolic health outcomes, potentially through actions in adipose tissues.",

Energy production for renal proximal tubule resorption of critical fuels and electrolytes is required for homeostasis. Cardiac energy for ventricular contraction/relaxation is preferentially supplied by long chain fatty acids. Metabolism of long chain fatty acids is accomplished within the cardiomyocyte cytoplasm and mitochondria by means of the glycolytic, tricarboxylic acid, and electron transport cycles. Toxic lipids and excessive lipid concentrations may inhibit cardiac function. Cardiac contraction requires calcium movement from the sarcoplasmic reticulum from a high to a low concentration at relatively low energy cost. Cardiac relaxation involves calcium return to the sarcoplasmic reticulum from a lower to a higher concentration and requires more energy consumption. Diastolic cardiac dysfunction occurs when cardiomyocyte energy conversion is inadequate. Diastolic dysfunction from diminished ATP availability occurs in the presence of inadequate blood pressure, glycemia, or lipid control and may lead to heart failure. Similar disruption of renal proximal tubular resorption of fuels/electrolytes has been found to be associated with phospholipid (sphingolipid) accumulation. Elevated concentrations of tissue oxidized low-density lipoprotein cholesterols are associated with loss of filtration efficiency at the level of the renal glomerular podocyte. Macroscopically excessive deposits of epicardial and intra-nephric adipose are associated with vascular pathology, fibrosis, and inhibition of essential functions in both heart and kidney.

        "Abstract": "Adipose tissue was once known as a reservoir for energy storage but is now considered a crucial organ for hormone and energy flux with important effects on health and disease. Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) is an incretin hormone secreted from the small intestinal K cells, responsible for augmenting insulin release, and has gained attention for its independent and amicable effects with glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), another incretin hormone secreted from the small intestinal L cells. The GIP receptor (GIPR) is found in whole adipose tissue, whereas the GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) is not, and some studies suggest that GIPR action lowers body weight and plays a role in lipolysis, glucose/lipid uptake/disposal, adipose tissue blood flow, lipid oxidation, and free-fatty acid (FFA) re-esterification, which may or may not be influenced by other hormones such as insulin. This review summarizes the research on the effects of GIP in adipose tissue (distinct depots of white and brown) using cellular, rodent, and human models. In doing so, we explore the mechanisms of GIPR-based medications for treating metabolic disorders, such as type 2 diabetes and obesity, and how GIPR agonism and antagonism contribute to improvements in metabolic health outcomes, potentially through actions in adipose tissues.",
