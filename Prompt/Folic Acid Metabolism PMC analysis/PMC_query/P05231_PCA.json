        "Abstract": "In this review, the author discusses the research that led to the identification and characterization of interleukin 6 (IL-6), including his own experience isolating IL-6, and the roles this cytokine has on autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. The cDNAs encoding B-cell stimulatory factor 2 (BSF-2), interferon (IFN)-beta2 and a 26-kDa protein were independently cloned in 1986, which in turn led to the identification of each. To resolve the confusing nomenclature, these identical molecules were named IL-6. Characterization of IL-6 revealed a multifunctional cytokine that is involved in not only immune responses but also hematopoiesis, inflammation, and bone metabolism. Moreover, IL-6 makes significant contributions to such autoimmune and inflammatory diseases as rheumatoid arthritis (RA).IL-6 activates both the STAT3 and SHP2/Gab/MAPK signaling pathways via the gp130 signal transducer. F759 mice, which contain a single amino-acid substitution in gp130 (Y759F) and show enhanced STAT3 activation, spontaneously develop a RA-like arthritis as they age. F759 arthritis is dependent on CD4(+) T cells, IL-6, and IL-17A, and is enhanced by the pX gene product from human T cell leukemia virus 1 (HTLV-1). Arthritis development in these mice requires that the F759 mutation is present in nonhematopoietic cells, but not in immune cells, highlighting the important role of the interaction between nonimmune tissues and the immune system in this disease. Furthermore, this interaction is mediated by the IL-6 amplifier through STAT3 and NF-kappaB. Ultimately, this model may represent a general etiologic process underlying other autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. More importantly, the understanding of IL-6 has paved the way for new therapeutic approaches for RA and other autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.",

Through the use of synthetic oligonucleotide technology, we have constructed a biologically active recombinant IL-6 (rIL-6) gene based on the sequence of a human IL-6 cDNA. The synthetic gene encodes a cysteine-free, bioengineered rIL-6 protein that is expressed at high levels in Escherichia coli as a tripartite fusion protein. Cleavage of the fusion protein with collagenase releases a 23-kDa rIL-6 protein that can be easily purified to homogeneity. We show that the rIL-6 protein displays a range of biological activities similar to those of natural human IL-6, as demonstrated by its ability to (i) protect cells from viral infection, (ii) stimulate the synthesis of fibrinogen in rat FAZA 967 cells, and (iii) induce the terminal differentiation of B cells, resulting in elevated secretion of immunoglobulin.",

        "Abstract": "Tibetan sheep have lived on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau for thousands of years and have good adaptability to the hypoxic environment and strong disease resistance. However, the molecular mechanism by which Tibetan sheep adapt to this extreme environment, especially the role of genetic regulation, is still unknown. Emerging evidence suggests that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) participate in the regulation of a diverse range of biological processes. To explore the potential lncRNAs involved in the adaptation to high-altitude hypoxia of Tibetan sheep, we analysed the expression profile of lncRNAs and mRNAs in the liver and lung tissues of sheep using comparative transcriptome analysis between four Tibetan sheep populations (high altitude) and one Hu sheep population (low altitude). The results showed a total of 7848 differentially expressed (DE) lncRNA transcripts, and 22,971 DE mRNA transcripts were detected by pairwise comparison. The expression patterns of selected mRNAs and lncRNAs were validated by qRT-PCR, and the results correlated well with the transcriptome data. Moreover, the functional annotation analysis based on the Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases showed that DE mRNAs and the target genes of the lncRNAs were significantly enriched in organ morphogenesis, response to stimulus, haem binding, the immune system, arginine and proline metabolism, and fatty acid biosynthesis. The prediction of mRNA-mRNA and lncRNA-mRNA interaction networks further revealed transcripts potentially involved in adaptation to high-altitude hypoxia, and the hub genes DDX24, PDCD11, EIF4A3, NDUFA11, SART1, PRPF8 and TCONS_00306477, TCONS_00306029, TCONS_00139593, TCONS_00293272, and TCONS_00313398 were selected. Additionally, a set of target genes, PIK3R1, IGF1R, FZD6, IFNB2, ATF3, MB, CYP2B4, PSMD13, and TGFB1, were also identified as candidate genes associated with high-altitude hypoxia adaptation. In conclusion, a collection of novel expressed lncRNAs, a set of target genes and biological pathways known to be relevant for altitude adaptation were identified by comparative transcriptome analysis between Tibetan sheep and Hu sheep. Our results are the first to identify the characterization and expression profile of lncRNAs between Tibetan sheep and Hu sheep and provide insights into the genetic regulation mechanisms by which Tibetan sheep adapt to high-altitude hypoxic environments.",

These cell lines, however, retained their ability to form tumors in irradiated pristane-treated mice. Analytical fractionation of a T cell supernatant rich in IL-HP1 by either gel filtration, isoelectric focusing, or reversed-phase HPLC revealed the existence of only one plasmacytoma growth factor activity that strictly copurified with IL-HP1, strongly suggesting the identity of both factors. This conclusion was further supported by the finding that IL-HP1 purified to homogeneity supported the growth of both B cell hybridomas and plasmacytomas.

        "Abstract": "Aromatic compounds are known anti-amyloid aggregates. Their effect on amorphous aggregates of proteins is, however, less studied. We chose aromatic amino acids Trp, Tyr, and Phe, as well as another known stabilizer (i.e. Arg), as potential compatible solvents to be tested on Bacillus amyloliquefaciens alpha-amylase (BAA). Among these additives, Phe was the only one to be effective on the thermal inactivation and amorphous aggregation of BAA, while preserving its intrinsic activity. A concentration of 50 mM Phe was used to test its potential in counteracting the deleterious effect of BAA amorphous aggregates in vivo. After 21 days of daily subcutaneous injections of the native enzyme to mice, amorphous aggregates of BAA, as well as aggregates produced in presence of 50 mM Phe, the tissues located at the site of injection were studied histologically. Amorphous aggregates caused an increase in macrophages and lipid droplets. Serum levels of IL6 and TNF-α were also accordingly elevated and indicative of an inflammation state. Aggregates also resulted into increased levels of glucose, triglycerides and cholesterol, as well as liver enzymes SGOT and SGPT. On the other hand, the presence of Phe prevented this exacerbated inflammatory state and the subsequent impairment of biochemical parameters. In conclusion, Phe is an interesting compound for both stabilizing proteins and counteracting the pathological effect of amorphous aggregates.",

        "Abstract": "This narrative review aims to examine the therapeutic potential and mechanism of action of plant extracts in preventing and treating alopecia (baldness). We searched and selected research papers on plant extracts related to hair loss, hair growth, or hair regrowth, and comprehensively compared the therapeutic efficacies, phytochemical components, and modulatory targets of plant extracts. These studies showed that various plant extracts increased the survival and proliferation of dermal papilla cells in vitro, enhanced cell proliferation and hair growth in hair follicles ex vivo, and promoted hair growth or regrowth in animal models in vivo. The hair growth-promoting efficacy of several plant extracts was verified in clinical trials. Some phenolic compounds, terpenes and terpenoids, sulfur-containing compounds, and fatty acids were identified as active compounds contained in plant extracts. The pharmacological effects of plant extracts and their active compounds were associated with the promotion of cell survival, cell proliferation, or cell cycle progression, and the upregulation of several growth factors, such as IGF-1, VEGF, HGF, and KGF (FGF-7), leading to the induction and extension of the anagen phase in the hair cycle. Those effects were also associated with the alleviation of oxidative stress, inflammatory response, cellular senescence, or apoptosis, and the downregulation of male hormones and their receptors, preventing the entry into the telogen phase in the hair cycle. Several active plant extracts and phytochemicals stimulated the signaling pathways mediated by protein kinase B (PKB, also called AKT), extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK), Wingless and Int-1 (WNT), or sonic hedgehog (SHH), while suppressing other cell signaling pathways mediated by transforming growth factor (TGF)-β or bone morphogenetic protein (BMP). Thus, well-selected plant extracts and their active compounds can have beneficial effects on hair health. It is proposed that the discovery of phytochemicals targeting the aforementioned cellular events and cell signaling pathways will facilitate the development of new targeted therapies for alopecia.",

        "Abstract": "We recently reported that microRNA (miR)-145 is downregulated and induces apoptosis in human bladder cancer cells. Also, it is suggested that the ectopic expression of miR-145 induces apoptosis with the induction of TRAIL expression in several cancer cells. Here, we demonstrated a novel mechanism of apoptosis induction by miR-145 in bladder cancer cells. Exogenous miR-145 in T24 and NKB1 cells markedly increased the expression levels of interferon (IFN)-β, 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase 1, which lies upstream of 2'-5' oligoadenylates/RNase L system, and TRAIL, and induced apparent caspase-dependent apoptosis that was suppressed by cotreatment with a pan-caspase inhibitor; moreover, these expression levels were reduced by cotreatment with an miR-145 inhibitor. The apoptosis did not depend on Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) expression, because TLR3-silencing failed to inhibit IFN-β induction by miR-145. Then, we focused on the suppressor of cytokine signaling 7 (socs7), whose expression level was upregulated in bladder cancer cells compared with its level in normal human urothelial cells, as a putative target gene involved in IFN-β induction by miR-145. Expectedly, exogenous miR-145 decreased the expression level of SOCS7, and socs7-silencing enhanced IFN-β induction by transfection with a TLR3 ligand, polyinosinic acid-polycytidylic acid (PIC). The results of a luciferase reporter assay revealed that miR-145 targeted socs7. In addition, socs7-silencing significantly decreased the level of p-Akt and suppressed the growth of T24 cells. Furthermore, exogenous miR-145 or socs7-silencing promoted nuclear translocation of STAT3. In conclusion, the machinery of IFN-β induction through the regulation of SOCS7 by miR-145 was closely associated with the induction of apoptosis. Moreover, exogenous miR-145 promoted IFN-β induction by targeting socs7, which resulted in the nuclear translocation of STAT3. Additionally, our data indicate that SOCS7 functioned as an oncogene, the finding that revealed a novel mechanism of carcinogenesis in bladder cancer cells.",

        "Abstract": "In this review, the author discusses the research that led to the identification and characterization of interleukin 6 (IL-6), including his own experience isolating IL-6, and the roles this cytokine has on autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. The cDNAs encoding B-cell stimulatory factor 2 (BSF-2), interferon (IFN)-beta2 and a 26-kDa protein were independently cloned in 1986, which in turn led to the identification of each. To resolve the confusing nomenclature, these identical molecules were named IL-6. Characterization of IL-6 revealed a multifunctional cytokine that is involved in not only immune responses but also hematopoiesis, inflammation, and bone metabolism. Moreover, IL-6 makes significant contributions to such autoimmune and inflammatory diseases as rheumatoid arthritis (RA).IL-6 activates both the STAT3 and SHP2/Gab/MAPK signaling pathways via the gp130 signal transducer. F759 mice, which contain a single amino-acid substitution in gp130 (Y759F) and show enhanced STAT3 activation, spontaneously develop a RA-like arthritis as they age. F759 arthritis is dependent on CD4(+) T cells, IL-6, and IL-17A, and is enhanced by the pX gene product from human T cell leukemia virus 1 (HTLV-1). Arthritis development in these mice requires that the F759 mutation is present in nonhematopoietic cells, but not in immune cells, highlighting the important role of the interaction between nonimmune tissues and the immune system in this disease. Furthermore, this interaction is mediated by the IL-6 amplifier through STAT3 and NF-kappaB. Ultimately, this model may represent a general etiologic process underlying other autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. More importantly, the understanding of IL-6 has paved the way for new therapeutic approaches for RA and other autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.",
