        "Abstract": "P2X(7) receptor subunits form homomeric ATP-gated, calcium-permeable cation channels. In this study, we used Western blots and immunocytochemistry to demonstrate that P2X(7) receptors are abundant on presynaptic terminals of mossy fiber synapses in the rat hippocampus. P2X(7)-immunoreactive protein was detected using a specific P2X(7) antibody in Western blots of protein isolated from whole hippocampus and from a subcellular fraction containing mossy fiber synaptosomes. P2X(7) immunoreactivity was colocalized with syntaxin 1A/B-immunoreactivity in mossy fiber terminals in the dentate hilus and stratum lucidum of CA3. Extracellular and whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings in CA3 revealed that bath application of the potent P2X(7) agonist 2',3'-O-(4-benzoylbenzoyl)-ATP (Bz-ATP) caused a long-lasting inhibition of neurotransmission at mossy fiber-CA3 synapses. Consistent with a presynaptic action at mossy fiber synapses, Bz-ATP had no significant effect on neurotransmission at associational-commissural synapses in CA3 but increased paired-pulse facilitation during depression of mossy fiber evoked currents. In addition, Bz-ATP had no postsynaptic effect on holding current or conductance of CA3 neurons. Bz-ATP-induced mossy fiber synaptic depression was blocked by the P2X(7) antagonist oxidized ATP but not by the P2X(1-3,5,6) antagonist pyridoxalphosphate-6-azophenyl-2',4'-disulfonic acid or the P2Y antagonist reactive blue 2. Finally, an antagonist of p38 MAP kinase activation [4-(4-fluorophenyl)2-(4-methylsulfinylphenyl)5-(4-pyridyl)imidazole] but not extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 MAP kinase (2'-amino-3'-methoxyflavone) blocked the synaptic depression mediated by Bz-ATP, suggesting that this presynaptic inhibition was mediated by activation of p38 MAP kinase. The results of the present study demonstrate that activation of presynaptic P2X(7) receptors depresses mossy fiber-CA3 synaptic transmission through activation of p38 MAP kinase.",

        "Abstract": "Fat1 is an atypical cadherin that controls vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation and migration. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase 1 (Nox1) is an important source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in VSMCs. Angiotensin II (Ang II) induces the expression and/or activation of both Fat1 and Nox1 proteins. This study tested the hypothesis that Ang II-induced Fat1 activation and VSMC migration are mediated by Nox1-dependent ROS generation and redox signaling. Studies were performed in cultured VSMCs from Sprague–Dawley rats. Cells were treated with Ang II (1 μmol/L) for short (5 to 30 min) or long term stimulations (3 to 12 h) in the absence or presence of the antioxidant apocynin (10 μmol/L), extracellular-signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (Erk1/2) inhibitor PD98059 (1 μmol/L), or Ang II type 1 receptor (AT1R) valsartan (1 μmol/L). siRNA was used to knockdown Nox1 or Fat1. Cell migration was determined by Boyden chamber assay. Ang II increased Fat1 mRNA and protein levels and promoted Fat1 translocation to the cell membrane, responses that were inhibited by AT1R antagonist and antioxidant treatment. Downregulation of Nox1 inhibited the effects of Ang II on Fat1 protein expression. Nox1 protein induction, ROS generation, and p44/p42 MAPK phosphorylation in response to Ang II were prevented by valsartan and apocynin, and Nox1 siRNA inhibited Ang II-induced ROS generation. Knockdown of Fat1 did not affect Ang II-mediated increases in Nox1 expression or ROS. Inhibition of p44/p42 MAPK phosphorylation by PD98059 abrogated the Ang II-induced increase in Fat1 expression and membrane translocation. Knockdown of Fat1 inhibited Ang II-induced VSMC migration, which was also prevented by valsartan, apocynin, PD98059, and Nox1 siRNA. Our findings indicate that Ang II regulates Fat1 expression and activity and induces Fat1-dependent VSMC migration via activation of AT1R, ERK1/2, and Nox1-derived ROS, suggesting a role for Fat1 downstream of Ang II signaling that leads to vascular remodeling.",

        "Abstract": "Bradykinin stimulates cAMP synthesis in cultured airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells. This occurs via a pathway that involves: (1) the protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK); (2) the MAPK-dependent phosphorylation and activation of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) and (3) the utilization of cPLA2-derived arachidonate by the cyclo-oxygenase pathway to produce prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). PGE2 is released and binds to cell surface receptors to stimulate intracellular cAMP synthesis. The signalling pathway was confirmed by the use of PD098059 [the inhibitor of MAPK kinase-1 (MEK-1) activation], AACOCF3 (an inhibitor of cPLA2) and indomethacin (an inhibitor of cyclo-oxygenase), which all reduced bradykinin-stimulated cAMP synthesis. Bradykinin also elicits the inhibition of approx. 60% of the total cAMP phosphodiesterase activity in the cell [Stevens, Pyne, Grady and Pyne (1994) Biochem. J. 297, 233-239]. This is likely to decrease the rate of cAMP degradation markedly and therefore to potentiate PGE2-stimulated cAMP synthesis. Acute treatment of ASM cells with PMA (a direct activator of PKC) also stimulated the MAPK-dependent phosphorylation of cPLA2. However, in contrast with bradykinin, PMA did not stimulate arachidonate release, suggesting that additional signals (e.g. Ca2+ ions) are required for phosphorylation by MAPK to activate cPLA2. PMA was also without effect on PGE2 release and cAMP synthesis. Evidence that PKC can also directly regulate adenylate cyclase was obtained by using cells pretreated with cholera toxin. Under these conditions, PMA stimulated cAMP synthesis independently of arachidonate metabolites. Furthermore the combined treatment of cells with PMA (to activate PKC) and PGE2 (to activate Gs) stimulated synergistic cAMP synthesis. This might be due to the presence of the type 2 adenylate cyclase, which is synergistically activated by Gs and PKC.",

        "Abstract": "Extracellular ATP and ADP, released from platelets and other sites stimulate the endothelial production of prostacyclin (PGI2) by acting on G-protein-coupled P2Y2 and P2Y2 purinoceptors, contributing to the maintenance of a non-thrombogenic surface. The mechanism, widely described as being dependent on elevated cytosolic [Ca2+], also requires protein tyrosine phosphorylation. Here we show that activation of both these P2 receptor types leads to the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of both the p42 and p44 forms of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). 2-Methylthio-ATP and UTP, selectively activating P2Y1 and P2Y2 purinoceptors respectively, and ATP, a non-selective agonist at these two receptors, stimulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of both p42mapk and p44mapk, as revealed by Western blots with an antiserum specific for the tyrosine-phosphorylated forms of the enzymes. By using separation on Resource Q columns, peptide kinase activity associated with the phosphorylated MAPK enzymes distributes into two peaks, one mainly p42mapk and one mainly p44mapk, both of which are stimulated by ATP with respect to kinase activity and phospho-MAPK immunoreactivity. Stimulation of P2Y1 or P2Y2 purinoceptors leads to a severalfold increase in PGI2 efflux; this was blocked in a dose-dependent manner by the selective MAPK kinase inhibitor PD98059. This drug also blocked the agonist-stimulated increase in phospho-MAPK immunoreactivity for both p42mapk and p44mapk but left the phospholipase C response to P2 agonists essentially unchanged. Olomoucine has been reported to inhibit p44mapk activity. Here we show that in the same concentration range olomoucine inhibits activity in both peaks from the Resource Q column and also the agonist stimulation of 6-keto-PGF1, but has no effect on agonist-stimulated phospho-MAPK immunoreactivity. These results provide direct evidence for the involvement of p42 and p44 MAPK in the PGI2 response of intact endothelial cells: we have shown that both the endothelial P2Y purinoceptors are linked to activation of MAPK, and that activation of this pathway is a requirement for the stimulation by ATP/ADP of endothelial PGI2 production.",

        "Abstract": "Within the ovarian follicle, granulosa cells (GCs) surround and support immature oocytes. FSH promotes the differentiation and proliferation of GCs and is essential for fertility. We recently reported that ERK activation is necessary for FSH to induce key genes that define the preovulatory GC. This research focused on the phosphoregulation by FSH of ERK within GCs. FSH-stimulated ERK phosphorylation on Thr(202)/Tyr(204) was PKA-dependent, but MEK(Ser(217)/Ser(221)) phosphorylation was not regulated; rather, MEK was already active. However, treatment of GCs with the EGF receptor inhibitor AG1478, a dominant-negative RAS, an Src homology 2 domain-containing Tyr phosphatase inhibitor (NSC 87877), or the MEK inhibitor PD98059 blocked FSH-dependent ERK(Thr(202)/Tyr(204)) phosphorylation, demonstrating the requirement for upstream pathway components. We hypothesized that FSH via PKA enhances ERK phosphorylation by inhibiting the activity of a protein phosphatase that constitutively dephosphorylates ERK in the absence of FSH, allowing MEK-phosphorylated ERK to accumulate in the presence of FSH because of inactivation of the phosphatase. GCs treated with different phosphatase inhibitors permitted elimination of both Ser/Thr and Tyr phosphatases and implicated dual specificity phosphatases (DUSPs) in the dephosphorylation of ERK. Treatment with MAP kinase phosphatase (MKP3, DUSP6) inhibitors increased ERK(Thr(202)/Tyr(204)) phosphorylation in the absence of FSH to levels comparable with ERK phosphorylated in the presence of FSH. ERK co-immunoprecipitated with Myc-FLAG-tagged MKP3(DUSP6). GCs treated with MKP3(DUSP6) inhibitors blocked and PKA inhibitors enhanced dephosphorylation of recombinant ERK2-GST in an in vitro phosphatase assay. Together, these results suggest that FSH-stimulated ERK activation in GCs requires the PKA-dependent inactivation of MKP3(DUSP6).",

        "Abstract": "Increased expression of trefoil factor 3 (TFF3) has been reported in colorectal carcinoma (CRC), being correlated with distant metastasis and poor clinical outcomes. Amongst the CRC subtypes, mesenchymal (CMS4) CRC is associated with the worst survival outcome. Herein, the functional roles of TFF3 and the pharmacological inhibition of TFF3 by a novel specific small molecule TFF3 inhibitor-2-amino-4-(4-(6-fluoro-5-methylpyridin-3-yl)phenyl)-5-oxo-4H,5H-pyrano[3,2-c]chromene-3-carbonitrile (AMPC) in CMS4 CRC was explored. Forced expression of TFF3 in CMS4 CRC cells promoted cell proliferation, cell survival, foci formation, invasion, migration, cancer stem cell like behaviour and growth in 3D Matrigel. In contrast, siRNA-mediated depletion of TFF3 or AMPC inhibition of TFF3 in CMS4 CRC cells decreased oncogenic behaviour as indicated by the above cell function assays. AMPC also inhibited tumour growth in vivo. The TFF3-stimulated oncogenic behaviour of CMS4 CRC cells was dependent on TFF3 activation of the p44/42 MAPK (ERK1/2) pathway. Furthermore, the forced expression of TFF3 decreased the sensitivity of CMS4 CRC cells to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU); while depleted TFF3 expression enhanced 5-FU sensitivity in CMS4 CRC cells. 5-FU treatment induced TFF3 expression in CMS4 CRC cells. AMPC, when used in combination with 5-FU in CMS4 CRC cells exhibited a synergistic inhibitory effect. In summary, this study provides functional evidence for TFF3 as a therapeutic target in CMS4 CRC.",

        "Abstract": "In this study, we evaluated the anti-melanogenesis effects of Caffeoylserotonin (CaS) in B16 melanoma cells. Treatment with CaS reduced the melanin content and tyrosinase (TYR) activity in B16 melanoma cells in a dose-dependent manner. CaS inhibited the expression of melanogenesis-related proteins, including microphthalmia- associated transcription factor (MITF), TYR, and tyrosinase-related protein-1 (TRP-1), but not TRP-2. α-MSH is known to interact with melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) thus activating adenylyl cyclase and increasing intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels. Furthermore, cAMP activates extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2) via phosphorylation, which phosphorylates MITF, thereby targeting the transcription factor to proteasomes for degradation. The CaS reduced intracellular cAMP levels to unstimulated levels and activated ERK phosphorylation within 30 min. The ERK inhibitor PD98059 abrogated the suppressive effect of CaS on α-MSH-induced melanogenesis. Based on this study, the inhibitory effects of CaS on melanogenesis are derived from the downregulation of MITF signaling via the inhibition of intracellular cAMP levels, as well as acceleration of ERK activation.",

        "Abstract": "The evolutionarily-conserved protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) plays a central role in dephosphorylation of phosphoproteins during the M phase of the cell cycle. We demonstrate here that the PP1 inhibitor inhibitor-2 protein (Inh-2) induces an M-phase arrest in Xenopus cycling egg extracts. Interestingly, the characteristics of this M-phase arrest are similar to those of mitogen-activated protein kinase (p42MAPK)-induced M-phase arrest. This prompted us to investigate whether Inh-2-induced M-phase arrest was dependent on activation of the p42MAPK pathway. We demonstrate here that MAPK activity is required for Inh-2-induced M-phase arrest, as inhibition of MAPK by PD98059 allowed cycling extracts to exit M phase, despite the presence of Inh-2. We next investigated whether Inh-2 phosphorylation by the MAPK pathway was required to induce an M-phase arrest. We discovered that while p90Rsk (a MAPK protein required for M-phase arrest) is able to phosphorylate Inh-2, this phosphorylation is not required for Inh-2 function. Overall, our results suggest a novel mechanism linking p42MAPK and PP1 pathways during M phase of the cell cycle.",

        "Abstract": "The A(1) adenosine receptor (A(1)AR) is coupled to G(i)/G(o) proteins, but the downstream signaling pathways in smooth muscle cells are unclear. This study was performed in coronary artery smooth muscle cells (CASMCs) isolated from the mouse heart [A(1)AR wild type (A(1)WT) and A(1)AR knockout (A(1)KO)] to delineate A(1)AR signaling through the PKC pathway. In A(1)WT cells, treatment with (2S)-N(6)-(2-endo-norbornyl)adenosine (ENBA; 10(-5)M) increased A(1)AR expression by 150%, which was inhibited significantly by the A(1)AR antagonist 1,3-dipropyl-8-cyclopentylxanthine (10(-6)M), but not in A(1)KO CASMCs. PKC isoforms were identified by Western blot analysis in the cytosolic and membrane fractions of cell homogenates of CASMCs. In A(1)WT and A(1)KO cells, significant levels of basal PKC-alpha were detected in the cytosolic fraction. Treatment with the A(1)AR agonist ENBA (10(-5)M) translocated PKC-alpha from the cytosolic to membrane fraction significantly in A(1)WT but not A(1)KO cells. Phospholipase C isoforms (betaI, betaIII, and gamma(1)) were analyzed using specific antibodies where ENBA treatment led to the increased expression of PLC-betaIII in A(1)WT CASMCs while having no effect in A(1)KO CASMCs. In A(1)WT cells, ENBA increased PKC-alpha expression and p42/p44 MAPK (ERK1/2) phospohorylation by 135% and 145%, respectively. These effects of ENBA were blocked by Gö-6976 (PKC-alpha inhibitor) and PD-98059 (p42/p44 MAPK inhibitor). We conclude that A(1)AR stimulation by ENBA activates the PKC-alpha signaling pathway, leading to p42/p44 MAPK phosphorylation in CASMCs.",

        "Abstract": "Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was found to induce inflammatory responses and to enhance bronchial hyperreactivity to several contractile agonists. However, the implication of LPS in the pathogenesis of bronchial hyperreactivity was not completely understood. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the effect of LPS on mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation associated with potentiation of bradykinin (BK)-induced inositol phosphates (IPs) accumulation and Ca(2+) mobilization in canine cultured tracheal smooth muscle cells (TSMCs). LPS stimulated phosphorylation of p42/p44 MAPK in a time- and concentration-dependent manner using a Western blot analysis against a specific phosphorylated form of MAPK antibody. Maximal stimulation of the p42 and p44 MAPK isoforms occurred after 7 min-incubation and the maximal effect was achieved with 100 microg ml(-1) LPS. Pretreatment of TSMCs with LPS potentiated BK-induced IPs accumulation and Ca(2+) mobilization. However, there was no effect on the IPs response induced by endothelin-1, 5-hydroxytryptamine, and carbachol. In addition, pretreatment with PDGF-BB enhanced BK-induced IPs response. These enhancements by LPS and PDGF-BB might be due to an increase in BK B(2) receptor density (B(max)) in TSMCs, characterized by competitive inhibition of [(3)H]-BK binding using B(1) and B(2) receptor-selective reagents. The enhancing effects of LPS and PDGF-BB were attenuated by PD98059, an inhibitor of MAPK kinase (MEK), suggesting that the effect of LPS may share a common signalling pathway with PDGF-BB in TSMCs. Furthermore, overexpression of dominant negative mutants, H-Ras-15A and Raf-N4, significantly suppressed p42/p44 MAPK activation induced by LPS and PDGF-BB, indicating that Ras and Raf may be required for activation of these kinases. These results suggest that the augmentation of BK-induced responses produced by LPS might be, at least in part, mediated through activation of Ras/Raf/MEK/MAPK pathway in TSMCs.",

The essential enzyme, thymidylate synthase (TS), is responsible for de novo synthesis of deoxythymidine monophosphate. The TS active site is relatively conserved between Cryptosporidium and human enzymes. In previous work, we identified compound 1, (2-amino-4-oxo-4,7-dihydro-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-methyl-phenyl-l-glutamic acid), as a promising selective Cryptosporidium hominis TS (ChTS) inhibitor. In the present study, we explore the structure-activity relationship around 1 glutamate moiety by synthesizing and biochemically evaluating the inhibitory activity of analogues against ChTS and human TS (hTS). X-Ray crystal structures were obtained for compounds bound to both ChTS and hTS. We establish the importance of the 2-phenylacetic acid moiety methylene linker in optimally positioning compounds 23, 24, and 25 within the active site. Moreover, through the comparison of structural data for 5, 14, 15, and 23 bound in both ChTS and hTS identified that active site rigidity is a driving force in determining inhibitor selectivity.",

        "Abstract": "Structural characterization of small molecules is a crucial component of organic synthesis. In this work, we applied microcrystal electron diffraction (MicroED) to analyze the structure of the product of an enzymatic reaction that was intended to produce the unnatural amino acid 2,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (24DHF). Characterization of our isolated product with nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and mass spectrometry (MS) suggested that an isomer of 24DHF had been formed. Microcrystals present in the isolated product were then used to determine its structure to 0.62 Å resolution, which confirmed its identity as 2-amino-2-(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid (24DHPA). Moreover, the MicroED structural model indicated that both enantiomeric forms of 24DHPA were present in the asymmetric unit. Notably, the entire structure determination process including setup, data collection, and refinement was completed in ~1 h. The MicroED data not only bolstered previous results obtained using NMR and MS but also immediately provided information about the stereoisomers present in the product, which is difficult to achieve using NMR and MS alone. Our results therefore demonstrate that MicroED methods can provide useful structural information on timescales that are similar to many commonly used analytical methods and can be added to the existing suite of small molecule structure determination tools in future studies.",
