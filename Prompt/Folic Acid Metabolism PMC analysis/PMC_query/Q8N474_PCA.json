        "Abstract": "Myxococcus xanthus, a nonflagellated gliding bacterium, exhibits multicellular behavior during vegetative growth and fruiting body formation. The frizzy (frz) genes are required to control directed motility for these interactions. The frz genes encode proteins that are homologous to all of the major enteric chemotaxis proteins, with the exception of CheZ. In this study, we characterized FrzCD, a protein which is homologous to the methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins from the enteric bacteria. FrzCD, unlike the other methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins, was found to be localized primarily in the cytoplasmic fraction of cells. FrzCD migrates as a ladder of bands on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, reflecting heterogeneity due to methylation or demethylation and to deamidation. FrzCD was shown to be methylated in vivo when cells were exposed to yeast extract or Casitone and demethylated when starved in buffer. We used the methylation state of FrzCD as revealed by Western blot (immunoblot) analyses to search for stimuli that are recognized by the frz signal transduction system. Common amino acids, nucleotides, vitamins, and sugars were not recognized, but certain lipids and alcohols were recognized. For example, the saturated fatty acids capric acid and lauric acid stimulated FrzCD methylation, whereas a variety of other saturated fatty acids did not. Lauryl alcohol and lipoic acid also stimulated methylation, as did phospholipids containing lauric acid. In contrast, several short-chain alcohols, such as isoamyl alcohol, and some other solvents caused demethylation. The relatively high concentrations of the chemicals required for a response may indicate that these chemicals are not the relevant signals recognized by M. xanthus in nature. Isoamyl alcohol and isopropanol also had profound effects on the behavior of wild-type cells, causing them to reverse continuously. Cells of frzB, frzF, and frzG mutants also reversed continuously in the presence of isoamyl alcohol, whereas cells of frzA, frzCD, or frzE mutants did not. On the basis of the data presented, we propose a model for the frz signal transduction pathway in M. xanthus.",

        "Abstract": "The frz genes of Myxococcus xanthus are necessary for proper aggregation of cells to form fruiting bodies. Mutations in the frz genes affect the frequency with which individual cells reverse their direction of movement. We have subcloned and determined the nucleotide sequence of three of the frz genes. From the sequence we predict three open reading frames corresponding to frzA, frzB, and frzCD. The putative FrzA protein (17,094 Da) exhibits 28.1% amino acid identity with the CheW protein of Salmonella typhimurium. The putative FrzCD protein (43,571 Da) contains a region of about 250 amino acids which is similar to the C-terminal portions of the methyl-accepting chemotaxis receptor proteins of the enteric bacteria. FrzCD also contains a region with potentially significant similarity to the DNA-binding region of the Bacillus subtilis sigma 43. The putative FrzB protein (12,066 Da) shares no significant identity with known chemotaxis proteins. The sequence similarities between the putative Frz proteins and the chemotaxis proteins of the enteric bacteria strongly support the hypothesis that the frz genes define a system of signal transduction analogous to the enterobacterial chemotaxis systems.",

        "Abstract": "The corrosion resistance of FRP-reinforced ordinary concrete members under the combined action of harsh environments (i.e., alkaline or acidic solutions, salt solutions) and freeze-thaw cycles is still unclear. To study the mechanical and apparent deterioration of carbon/basalt/glass/aramid fiber cloth reinforced concrete under chemical and freeze-thaw coupling. Plain concrete blocks and FRP-bonded concrete blocks were fabricated. The tensile properties of the FRP sheet and epoxy resin sheet before and after chemical freezing, the compressive strength of the FRP reinforced test block, and the bending capacity of the prismatic test block pasted with FRP on the prefabricated crack side were tested. The deterioration mechanism of the test block was analyzed through the change of surface photos. Based on the experimental data, the Lam-Teng constitutive model of concrete reinforced by alkali-freeze coupling FRP is modified. The results indicate that, in terms of apparent properties, with the increase in the duration of chemical freeze-thaw erosion, the surface of epoxy resin sheets exhibits an increase in pores, along with the emergence of small cracks and wrinkles. The texture of FRP sheets becomes blurred, and cracks and wrinkles appear on the surface. In terms of failure modes, as the number of chemical coupling erosion cycles increases, the location of failure in epoxy resin sheets becomes uncertain, and the failure plane tilts towards the direction of the applied load. The failure mode of FRP sheets remains unchanged. However, the bonding strength between FRP sheets and concrete decreases, resulting in a weakened reinforcement effect. In terms of mechanical properties, FRP sheets undergo the most severe degradation in the coupled environment of acid freeze-thaw cycles. Among them, GFRP experiences the largest degradation in tensile strength, reaching up to 30.17%. In terms of tensile performance, the sheets rank from highest to lowest as follows: CFRP, BFRP, AFRP, and GFRP.As the duration of chemical freeze-coupled erosion increases, the loss rate of compressive strength for specimens bonded with CFRP is the smallest (9.62% in salt freeze-thaw environment), while the loss rate of bearing capacity is higher for specimens reinforced with GFRP (33.8% in acid freeze-thaw environment). In contrast, the loss rate of bearing capacity is lower for specimens reinforced with CFRP (13.6% in salt freeze-thaw environment), but still higher for specimens reinforced with GFRP (25.8% in acid freeze-thaw environment).",

The successful synthesis was validated by attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD). Thermal analysis using differential scanning calorimetry confirmed the glass transition temperature of MGM-ILs to be within the range of -43.4 °C--13.8 °C. We investigated the solubilization of 15 drugs with varying pKa and partition coefficient (log P) values using these ILs and performed a comparative analysis. Furthermore, we present MGM-IL as a new skin permeation enhancer for the drug model flurbiprofen (FRP). We confirmed that AA/MGM-IL improves the skin permeation of FRP through hairless mouse skin. Moreover, AA/MGM-IL enhanced drug skin permeability by affecting keratin rather than stratum corneum lipids, as confirmed by ATR-FTIR.

To study the mechanical and apparent deterioration of carbon/basalt/glass/aramid fiber cloth reinforced concrete under chemical and freeze-thaw coupling. Plain concrete blocks and FRP-bonded concrete blocks were fabricated. The tensile properties of the FRP sheet and epoxy resin sheet before and after chemical freezing, the compressive strength of the FRP reinforced test block, and the bending capacity of the prismatic test block pasted with FRP on the prefabricated crack side were tested. The deterioration mechanism of the test block was analyzed through the change of surface photos. Based on the experimental data, the Lam-Teng constitutive model of concrete reinforced by alkali-freeze coupling FRP is modified. The results indicate that, in terms of apparent properties, with the increase in the duration of chemical freeze-thaw erosion, the surface of epoxy resin sheets exhibits an increase in pores, along with the emergence of small cracks and wrinkles. The texture of FRP sheets becomes blurred, and cracks and wrinkles appear on the surface. In terms of failure modes, as the number of chemical coupling erosion cycles increases, the location of failure in epoxy resin sheets becomes uncertain, and the failure plane tilts towards the direction of the applied load. The failure mode of FRP sheets remains unchanged. However, the bonding strength between FRP sheets and concrete decreases, resulting in a weakened reinforcement effect. In terms of mechanical properties, FRP sheets undergo the most severe degradation in the coupled environment of acid freeze-thaw cycles. Among them, GFRP experiences the largest degradation in tensile strength, reaching up to 30.17%. In terms of tensile performance, the sheets rank from highest to lowest as follows: CFRP, BFRP, AFRP, and GFRP.As the duration of chemical freeze-coupled erosion increases, the loss rate of compressive strength for specimens bonded with CFRP is the smallest (9.62% in salt freeze-thaw environment), while the loss rate of bearing capacity is higher for specimens reinforced with GFRP (33.8% in acid freeze-thaw environment). In contrast, the loss rate of bearing capacity is lower for specimens reinforced with CFRP (13.6% in salt freeze-thaw environment), but still higher for specimens reinforced with GFRP (25.8% in acid freeze-thaw environment).",

        "Abstract": "Polymeric frustrated Lewis pairs, or poly(FLP)s, have served to bridge the gap between functional polymer science and main group catalysis, pairing the uniqueness of sterically frustrated Lewis acids and bases with a polymer scaffold to create self-healing gels and recyclable catalysts. However, their utilization in radical chemistry is unprecedented. In this paper, we disclose the synthesis of polymeric frustrated radical pairs, or poly(FRP)s, by in situ photoinduction of FLP moieties, where their Lewis acidic and basic centers are tuned to promote single electron transfer (SET). Through systematic manipulation of the chemical structure, we demonstrate that inclusion of ortho-methyl groups on phosphine monomers is crucial to enable SET. The generation of radicals is evidenced by monitoring the stable polymeric phosphine radical cations via UV/vis and EPR spectroscopy. These new poly(FRP)s enable both catalytic hydrogenation and radical-mediated photocatalytic perfluoroalkylations. These polymeric radical systems open new avenues to design novel functional polymers for catalysis and photoelectrical chemistry.",

        "Abstract": "A 3D printed composite via the fused filament fabrication (FFF) technique has potential to enhance the mechanical properties of FFF 3D printed parts. The most commonly employed techniques for 3D composite printing (method 1) utilized premixed composite filaments, where the fibers were integrated into thermoplastic materials prior to printing. In the second method (method 2), short fibers and thermoplastic were mixed together within the extruder of a 3D printer to form a composite part. However, no research has been conducted on method 3, which involves embedding short fibers into the printed object during the actual printing process. A novel approach concerning 3D printing in situ fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) by embedding glass fibers between deposited layers during printing was proposed recently. An experimental investigation has been undertaken to evaluate the tensile behavior of the composites manufactured by the new manufacturing method. Neat polylactic acid (PLA) and three different glass fiber-reinforced polylactic acid (GFPLA) composites with 1.02%, 2.39%, and 4.98% glass fiber contents, respectively, were 3Dprinted. Tensile tests were conducted with five repetitions for each sample. The fracture surfaces of the samples were then observed under scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In addition, the porosities of the 3D printed samples were measured with a image processing software (ImageJ 1.53t). The result shows that the tensile strengths of GFPLA were higher than the neat PLA. The tensile strength of the composites increased from GFPLA-1 (with a 1.02% glass fiber content) to GFPLA-2.4 (with a 2.39% glass fiber content), but drastically dropped at GFPLA-5 (with a 4.98% glass fiber content). However, the tensile strength of GFPLA-5 is still higher than the neat PLA. The fracture surfaces of tensile samples were observed under scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The SEM images showed the average line width of the deposited material increased as glass fiber content increased, while layer height was maintained. The intralayer bond of the deposited filaments improved via the new fiber embedding method. Hence, the porosity area is reduced as glass fiber content increased.",

        "Abstract": "Ruditapes philippinarum, is an economically important marine bivalve species. The ability to cope with low salinity stress is quite important for the survival of aquatic species under natural conditions. In this study, the transcriptional response of the Manila clam to low salinity stress was characterized using RNA sequencing. The transcriptomes of a low salinity-treatment group (FRp1, FRp2), which survived under low salinity stress, and control group (SRp1, SRp2), which was not subjected to low salinity stress, were sequenced with the Illumina HiSeq platform. A total of 196,578 unigenes were generated. GO and KEGG analyses revealed that signal transduction, immune response, cellular component organization or biogenesis, and energy production processes were the most highly enriched pathways among the genes that were differentially expressed under low salinity stress. All these pathways could be assigned to the following biological functions in the low salinity tolerant Manila clam: signal response to low salinity stress, antioxidant response, intracellular free amino acid transport and metabolism, energy production and conversion, cell signaling pathways, and regulation of ionic content and cell volume. In summary, this is the first study using high-throughput sequencing to identify gene targets that could explain osmotic regulation mechanisms under salinity stress in R. philippinarum.",

The F. oxysporum and B. cinerea deletion mutants showed opposite growth phenotypes on sugar and nonsugar carbon sources. Replacement of FoFRP1 in F. oxysporum with the B. cinerea BcFRP1 resulted in the restoration of pathogenicity, but also in a switch from impaired growth on nonsugar carbon sources to impaired growth on sugar carbon sources. This effect could be ascribed in part to the B. cinerea BcFRP1 promoter sequence.

        "Abstract": "Studies have shown the fundamental contribution of the yeast vacuole as a site for storage and detoxification of metals. Whereas the transmembrane proteins responsible for iron transport into and out of the vacuole have been identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, less information is available concerning the mobilization of vacuolar iron stores in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. In this study, we report the identification of a gene designated abc3(+) that encodes a protein which exhibits sequence homology with the ABCC subfamily of ATP-binding cassette transporters. The transcription of abc3(+) is induced by low concentrations of iron but repressed by high levels of iron. The iron-mediated repression of abc3(+) required a functional fep1(+) gene. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that Fep1 associates with the abc3(+) promoter in vivo, in an iron-dependent manner. Microscopic analyses revealed that a functional Abc3-green fluorescent protein localizes to the membrane vacuole when iron levels were low. Abc3 was required for growth in low-iron medium in the absence of the transport system mediated by Fio1 and Fip1. abc3Delta cells exhibited increased levels of expression of the frp1(+)-encoded ferric reductase, suggesting a loss of Fep1 repression and, consequently, the activation of Fep1-regulated genes. When abc3(+) was expressed using the nmt1(+) promoter system, its induction led to a reduced transcriptional activity of the frp1(+) gene. Because S. pombe does not possess vacuolar membrane-localized orthologs to S. cerevisiae Fth1, Fet5, and Smf3, our findings suggested that Abc3 may be responsible for mobilizing stored iron from the vacuole to the cytosol in response to iron deficiency.",

        "Abstract": "Iron is an essential nutrient that is severely limited in the mammalian host. Candida albicans encodes a family of 15 putative ferric reductases, which are required for iron acquisition and utilization. Despite the central role of ferric reductases in iron acquisition and mobilization, relatively little is known about the regulatory networks that govern ferric reductase gene expression in C. albicans. Here we have demonstrated the differential regulation of two ferric reductases, FRE2 and FRP1, in response to distinct iron-limited environments. FRE2 and FRP1 are both induced in alkaline-pH environments directly by the Rim101 transcription factor. However, FRP1 but not FRE2 is also induced by iron chelation. We have identified a CCAAT motif as the critical regulatory sequence for chelator-mediated induction and have found that the CCAAT binding factor (CBF) is essential for FRP1 expression in iron-limited environments. We found that a hap5Delta/hap5Delta mutant, which disrupts the core DNA binding activity of CBF, is unable to grow under iron-limited conditions. C. albicans encodes three CBF-dependent transcription factors, and we identified the Hap43 protein as the CBF-dependent transcription factor required for iron-limited responses. These studies provide key insights into the regulation of ferric reductase gene expression in the fungal pathogen C. albicans.",

Sexual reproduction, however, was impaired in both F. graminearum and B. cinerea FRP1 deletion mutants. The mutants of all three fungi displayed different phenotypes when grown on an array of carbon sources. The F. oxysporum and B. cinerea deletion mutants showed opposite growth phenotypes on sugar and nonsugar carbon sources. Replacement of FoFRP1 in F. oxysporum with the B. cinerea BcFRP1 resulted in the restoration of pathogenicity, but also in a switch from impaired growth on nonsugar carbon sources to impaired growth on sugar carbon sources. This effect could be ascribed in part to the B. cinerea BcFRP1 promoter sequence. In conclusion, the function of the F-box protein Frp1, despite its high sequence conservation, is not conserved between different fungi, leading to differential requirements for pathogenicity and carbon source utilization.",

        "Abstract": "Studies have shown the fundamental contribution of the yeast vacuole as a site for storage and detoxification of metals. Whereas the transmembrane proteins responsible for iron transport into and out of the vacuole have been identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, less information is available concerning the mobilization of vacuolar iron stores in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. In this study, we report the identification of a gene designated abc3(+) that encodes a protein which exhibits sequence homology with the ABCC subfamily of ATP-binding cassette transporters. The transcription of abc3(+) is induced by low concentrations of iron but repressed by high levels of iron. The iron-mediated repression of abc3(+) required a functional fep1(+) gene. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that Fep1 associates with the abc3(+) promoter in vivo, in an iron-dependent manner. Microscopic analyses revealed that a functional Abc3-green fluorescent protein localizes to the membrane vacuole when iron levels were low. Abc3 was required for growth in low-iron medium in the absence of the transport system mediated by Fio1 and Fip1. abc3Delta cells exhibited increased levels of expression of the frp1(+)-encoded ferric reductase, suggesting a loss of Fep1 repression and, consequently, the activation of Fep1-regulated genes. When abc3(+) was expressed using the nmt1(+) promoter system, its induction led to a reduced transcriptional activity of the frp1(+) gene. Because S. pombe does not possess vacuolar membrane-localized orthologs to S. cerevisiae Fth1, Fet5, and Smf3, our findings suggested that Abc3 may be responsible for mobilizing stored iron from the vacuole to the cytosol in response to iron deficiency.",

Candida albicans encodes a family of 15 putative ferric reductases, which are required for iron acquisition and utilization. Despite the central role of ferric reductases in iron acquisition and mobilization, relatively little is known about the regulatory networks that govern ferric reductase gene expression in C. albicans. Here we have demonstrated the differential regulation of two ferric reductases, FRE2 and FRP1, in response to distinct iron-limited environments. FRE2 and FRP1 are both induced in alkaline-pH environments directly by the Rim101 transcription factor. However, FRP1 but not FRE2 is also induced by iron chelation. We have identified a CCAAT motif as the critical regulatory sequence for chelator-mediated induction and have found that the CCAAT binding factor (CBF) is essential for FRP1 expression in iron-limited environments. We found that a hap5Delta/hap5Delta mutant, which disrupts the core DNA binding activity of CBF, is unable to grow under iron-limited conditions. C. albicans encodes three CBF-dependent transcription factors, and we identified the Hap43 protein as the CBF-dependent transcription factor required for iron-limited responses. These studies provide key insights into the regulation of ferric reductase gene expression in the fungal pathogen C. albicans.",

The ability to cope with low salinity stress is quite important for the survival of aquatic species under natural conditions. In this study, the transcriptional response of the Manila clam to low salinity stress was characterized using RNA sequencing. The transcriptomes of a low salinity-treatment group (FRp1, FRp2), which survived under low salinity stress, and control group (SRp1, SRp2), which was not subjected to low salinity stress, were sequenced with the Illumina HiSeq platform. A total of 196,578 unigenes were generated. GO and KEGG analyses revealed that signal transduction, immune response, cellular component organization or biogenesis, and energy production processes were the most highly enriched pathways among the genes that were differentially expressed under low salinity stress. All these pathways could be assigned to the following biological functions in the low salinity tolerant Manila clam: signal response to low salinity stress, antioxidant response, intracellular free amino acid transport and metabolism, energy production and conversion, cell signaling pathways, and regulation of ionic content and cell volume. In summary, this is the first study using high-throughput sequencing to identify gene targets that could explain osmotic regulation mechanisms under salinity stress in R. philippinarum.",

To gauge the contributions of individual CTD coding \"letters\" to gene expression, we analyzed the poly(A)(+) transcriptomes of fission yeast mutants that lack each of the four inessential CTD phosphoacceptors: Tyr1, Ser2, Thr4, and Ser7. There was a hierarchy of CTD mutational effects with respect to the number of dysregulated protein-coding RNAs, with S2A (n = 227) >> Y1F (n = 71) > S7A (n = 58) >> T4A (n = 7). The majority of the protein-coding RNAs affected in Y1F cells were coordinately affected by S2A, suggesting that Tyr1-Ser2 constitutes a two-letter code \"word.\" Y1F and S2A elicited increased expression of genes encoding proteins involved in iron uptake (Frp1, Fip1, Fio1, Str3, Str1, Sib1), without affecting the expression of the genes that repress the iron regulon, implying that Tyr1-Ser2 transduces a repressive signal. Y1F and S2A cells had increased levels of ferric reductase activity and were hypersensitive to phleomycin, indicative of elevated intracellular iron. The T4A and S7A mutations had opposing effects on the phosphate response pathway. T4A reduced the expression of two genes encoding proteins involved in phosphate acquisition (the Pho1 acid phosphatase and the phosphate transporter SPBC8E4.01c), without affecting the expression of known genes that regulate the phosphate response pathway, whereas S7A increased pho1(+) expression. These results highlight specific cellular gene expression programs that are responsive to distinct CTD cues.",

        "Abstract": "In the conventional secretory pathway, cargo receptors play important roles in exporting newly synthesized secretory proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We previously showed that a cargo receptor, surfeit locus protein 4 (SURF4), promotes ER export of a soluble signaling molecule, sonic hedgehog, via recognizing the polybasic residues within its Cardin-Weintraub motif. In addition to sonic hedgehog, we found 30 more secretory proteins containing the polybasic motif (K/R)(K/R)(K/R)XX(K/R)(K/R), but whether SURF4 plays a general role in mediating ER export of these secretory proteins is unclear. Here, we analyzed the trafficking of four of these secretory proteins: desert hedgehog, Indian hedgehog, bone morphogenetic protein 8A (BMP8A), and secreted frizzled-related protein 1 (SFRP1). We found that the polybasic motifs contained in these cargo proteins are important for their ER export. Further analyses indicated that the polybasic motifs of BMP8A and SFRP1 interact with the triacidic motif on the predicted first luminal domain of SURF4. These interactions with SURF4 are essential and sufficient for the ER-to-Golgi trafficking of BMP8A and SFRP1. Moreover, we demonstrated that SURF4 localizes at a subpopulation of ER exit sites to regulate the ER export of its clients. Taken together, these results suggest that SURF4 is recruited to specific ER exit sites and plays a general role in capturing polybasic motif-containing secretory cargo proteins through electrostatic interactions.",

A review of the literature that investigated the biomarkers involved in OPLL was published in 2019. The review cited 11 reports in which a calcium phosphate metabolism marker, bone turnover markers, sclerostin, dickkopf-1, secreted frizzled-related protein-1, fibroblast growth factor-23, fibronectin, menatetrenone, leptin, pentosidine, and hypersensitive C-reactive protein were examined as markers. Data published in 2021 noted that non-coding RNAs might be useful biomarkers for OSL. In addition, triglycerides, uric acid, gene expression levels of interleukin-17 receptor C, chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 7 (CXCL7) in the serum reportedly are biomarkers of OSL. However, several issues have been raised in previous studies. Therefore, biomarkers have yet to be conclusively investigated.

        "Abstract": "In the conventional secretory pathway, cargo receptors play important roles in exporting newly synthesized secretory proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We previously showed that a cargo receptor, surfeit locus protein 4 (SURF4), promotes ER export of a soluble signaling molecule, sonic hedgehog, via recognizing the polybasic residues within its Cardin-Weintraub motif. In addition to sonic hedgehog, we found 30 more secretory proteins containing the polybasic motif (K/R)(K/R)(K/R)XX(K/R)(K/R), but whether SURF4 plays a general role in mediating ER export of these secretory proteins is unclear. Here, we analyzed the trafficking of four of these secretory proteins: desert hedgehog, Indian hedgehog, bone morphogenetic protein 8A (BMP8A), and secreted frizzled-related protein 1 (SFRP1). We found that the polybasic motifs contained in these cargo proteins are important for their ER export. Further analyses indicated that the polybasic motifs of BMP8A and SFRP1 interact with the triacidic motif on the predicted first luminal domain of SURF4. These interactions with SURF4 are essential and sufficient for the ER-to-Golgi trafficking of BMP8A and SFRP1. Moreover, we demonstrated that SURF4 localizes at a subpopulation of ER exit sites to regulate the ER export of its clients. Taken together, these results suggest that SURF4 is recruited to specific ER exit sites and plays a general role in capturing polybasic motif-containing secretory cargo proteins through electrostatic interactions.",

This review paper summarizes the contents of previous reviews, introduces recent advances in the study of OSL and discusses future perspectives. A review of the literature that investigated the biomarkers involved in OPLL was published in 2019.

Data published in 2021 noted that non-coding RNAs might be useful biomarkers for OSL. In addition, triglycerides, uric acid, gene expression levels of interleukin-17 receptor C, chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 7 (CXCL7) in the serum reportedly are biomarkers of OSL.
