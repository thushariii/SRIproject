        "Abstract": "Atherosclerosis (AS) is a chronic immuno‑inflammatory disease accompanied by dyslipidemia. The authors previously demonstrated that sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) may prevent atherogenesis through influencing the liver X receptor/C‑C chemokine receptor type 7/nuclear factor‑κB (LXR‑CCR7/NF‑κB) signaling pathway. Previous studies have suggested a role for mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. The present study investigated the potential association between mTOR signaling and SIRT1‑LXR‑CCR7/NF‑κB signaling (SIRT1 signaling) in AS pathogenesis. To induce foam cell formation, U937 cells were differentiated into macrophages by exposure to phorbol 12‑myristate 13‑acetate (PMA) for 24 h, followed by treatment with palmitate and oxidized low density lipoprotein for a further 24 h. Oil red O staining revealed a large accumulation of lipid droplets present in foam cells. Western blot analysis demonstrated increased protein levels of phosphorylated (p)‑mTOR and its downstream factor p‑ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K). Reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analyses additionally revealed decreased expression of SIRT1, LXRα and CCR7 and increased expression of NF‑κB and its downstream factor tumor necrosis factor‑α (TNF‑α) in an atherogenetic condition induced by lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). In addition, abundant lipid droplets accumulated in U937‑LPA‑treated foam cells. Rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor, suppressed the expression and activity of mTOR and p70S6K, however enhanced expression of SIRT1, LXRα, and CCR7. Conversely, rapamycin deceased TNF‑α and NF‑κB activity, the latter of which was further confirmed by immunofluorescence analysis demonstrating increased levels of NF‑κB present in the cytoplasm compared with the nucleus. The findings of the present study suggest that mTOR signaling promotes foam cell formation and inhibits foam cell egress via suppression of SIRT1 signaling.",

        "Abstract": "A modified mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation is a highly effective and precise treatment for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), with a significant curative effect. Thus, we aim to examine the efficacy of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α-overexpressing MSC (HIF-MSC) transplantation in experimental colitis and investigate the immunity regulation mechanisms of HIF-MSC through macrophages. A chronic experimental colitis mouse model was established using 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid. HIF-MSC transplantation significantly attenuated colitis in weight loss rate, disease activity index (DAI), colon length, and pathology score and effectively rebuilt the local and systemic immune balance. Macrophage depletion significantly impaired the benefits of HIF-MSCs on mice with colitis. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that HIF-MSCs significantly decreased the number of M1-like macrophages and increased the number of M2-like macrophages in colon tissues. In vitro, co-culturing with HIF-MSCs significantly decreased the expression of pro-inflammatory factors, C-C chemokine receptor 7 (CCR-7), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (INOS) and increased the expression of anti-inflammatory factors and arginase I (Arg-1) in induced M1-like macrophages. Flow cytometry revealed that co-culturing with HIF-MSCs led to a decrease in the proportions of M1-like macrophages and an increase in that of M2-like macrophages. HIF-MSCs treatment notably upregulated the expression of downstream molecular targets of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-γ (PI3K-γ), including HIF-1α and p-AKT/AKT in the colon tissue. A selected PI3K-γ inhibitor, IPI549, attenuated these effects, as well as the effect on M2-like macrophage polarization and inflammatory cytokines in colitis mice. In vitro, HIF-MSCs notably upregulated the expression of C/EBPβ and AKT1/AKT2, and PI3K-γ inhibition blocked this effect. Modified MSCs stably overexpressed HIF-1α, which effectively regulated macrophage polarization through PI3K-γ. HIF-MSC transplantation may be a potentially effective precision therapy for IBD.",

EBI 1 is expressed exclusively in B- and T-lymphocyte cell lines and in lymphoid tissues and is highly homologous to the interleukin 8 receptors. EBI 2 is most closely related to the thrombin receptor. EBI 2 is expressed in B-lymphocyte cell lines and in lymphoid tissues but not in T-lymphocyte cell lines or peripheral blood T lymphocytes. EBI 2 is also expressed at lower levels in a promyelocytic and a histiocytic cell line and in pulmonary tissue. These predicted G protein-coupled peptide receptors are more likely to be mediators of EBV effects on B lymphocytes or of normal lymphocyte functions than are genes previously known to be up-regulated by EBV infection.",
