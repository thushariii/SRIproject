        "Abstract": "The neurite outgrowth inhibitor protein Nogo is one of 300 proteins that contain a reticulon homology domain, which is responsible for their association with the endoplasmic reticulum. Here we have found that the Nogo-B spliceform becomes phosphorylated at Ser107 in response to lipopolysaccharide in RAW264 macrophages or anisomycin in HeLa cells. The phosphorylation is prevented by SB 203580, an inhibitor of SAPK2a (stress-activated protein kinase 2a)/p38a and SAPK2b/p38b, and does not occur in embryonic fibroblasts generated from SAPK2a/p38a-deficient mice. Nogo-B is phosphorylated at Ser107 in vitro by MAPKAP-K2 [MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase)-activated protein kinase-2] or MAPKAP-K3, but not by other protein kinases that are known to be activated by SAPK2a/p38a. The anisomycin-induced phosphorylation of Ser107 in HeLa cells can be prevented by 'knockdown' of MAPKAP-K2 using siRNA (small interfering RNA). Taken together, our results identify Nogo-B as a new physiological substrate of MAPKAP-K2.",

        "Abstract": "Soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) is an enzyme involved in the metabolism of bioactive lipid signaling molecules. sEH converts epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EET) to virtually inactive dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids (DHET). The first acids are \"medicinal\" molecules, the second increase the inflammatory infiltration of cells. Mitogen-activated protein kinases (p38 MAPKs) are key protein kinases involved in the production of inflammatory mediators, including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). p38 MAPK signaling plays an important role in the regulation of cellular processes, especially inflammation. The proto-oncogenic serine/threonine protein kinase Raf (c-Raf) is a major component of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway: ERK1/2 signaling. Normal cellular Raf genes can also mutate and become oncogenes, overloading the activity of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2. The development of multitarget inhibitors is a promising strategy for the treatment of socially dangerous diseases. We synthesized 1,3-disubstituted ureas and diureas containing a dichloroadamantyl moiety. The results of computational methods show that soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibitors can act on two more targets in different signaling pathways of mitogen-activated protein kinases p38 MAPK and c-Raf. The two chlorine atoms in the adamantyl moiety may provide additional Cl-π interactions in the active site of human sEH. Molecular dynamics studies have shown that the stability of ligand-protein complexes largely depends on the \"spacer effect.\" The compound containing a bridge between the chloroadamantyl fragment and the ureide group forms more stable ligand-protein complexes with sEH and p38 MAPK, which indicates a better conformational ability of the molecule in the active sites of these targets. In turn, a compound containing two chlorine atoms forms a more stable complex with c-Raf, probably due to the presence of additional halogen bonds of chlorine atoms with amino acid residues.",

This study investigated the pharmacological effects of adiponectin replacement therapy with the adiponectin-derived peptide ALY688 (ALY688-SR) in a mouse model of MASH. Human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell-derived hepatocytes were used to test cytotoxicity and signaling of unmodified ALY688 in vitro. High-fat diet with low methionine and no added choline (CDAHF) was used to induce MASH and test the effects of ALY688-SR in vivo. Histological MASH activity score (NAS) and fibrosis score were determined to assess the effect of ALY688-SR. Transcriptional characterization of mice through RNA sequencing was performed to indicate potential molecular mechanisms involved. In cultured hepatocytes, ALY688 efficiently induced adiponectin-like signaling, including the AMP-activated protein kinase and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, and did not elicit cytotoxicity. Administration of ALY688-SR in mice did not influence body weight but significantly ameliorated CDAHF-induced hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis, therefore effectively preventing the development and progression of MASH. Mechanistically, ALY688-SR treatment markedly induced hepatic expression of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation, whereas it significantly suppressed the expression of pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic genes as demonstrated by transcriptomic analysis. ALY688-SR may represent an effective approach in MASH treatment.

        "Abstract": "A widely expressed protein containing UBA (ubiquitin-associated) and UBX (ubiquitin-like) domains was identified as a substrate of SAPKs (stress-activated protein kinases). Termed SAKS1 (SAPK substrate-1), it was phosphorylated efficiently at Ser200 in vitro by SAPK3/p38gamma, SAPK4/p38delta and JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase), but weakly by SAPK2a/p38alpha, SAPK2b/p38beta2 or ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase) 2. Ser200, situated immediately N-terminal to the UBX domain, became phosphorylated in HEK-293 (human embryonic kidney) cells in response to stressors. Phosphorylation was not prevented by SB 203580 (an inhibitor of SAPK2a/p38alpha and SAPK2b/p38beta2) and/or PD 184352 (which inhibits the activation of ERK1 and ERK2), and was similar in fibroblasts lacking both SAPK3/p38gamma and SAPK4/p38delta or JNK1 and JNK2. SAKS1 bound ubiquitin tetramers and VCP (valosin-containing protein) in vitro via the UBA and UBX domains respectively. The amount of VCP in cell extracts that bound to immobilized GST (glutathione S-transferase)-SAKS1 was enhanced by elevating the level of polyubiquitinated proteins, while SAKS1 and VCP in extracts were coimmunoprecipitated with an antibody raised against S5a, a component of the 19 S proteasomal subunit that binds polyubiquitinated proteins. PNGase (peptide N-glycanase) formed a 1:1 complex with VCP and, for this reason, also bound to immobilized GST-SAKS1. We suggest that SAKS1 may be an adaptor that directs VCP to polyubiquitinated proteins, and PNGase to misfolded glycoproteins, facilitating their destruction by the proteasome.",

        "Abstract": "SAPK3 (stress-activated protein kinase-3, also known as p38gamma) is a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family; it phosphorylates substrates in response to cellular stress, and has been shown to bind through its C-terminal sequence to the PDZ domain of alpha1-syntrophin. In the present study, we show that SAP90 [(synapse-associated protein 90; also known as PSD-95 (postsynaptic density-95)] is a novel physiological substrate for both SAPK3/p38gamma and the ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated protein kinase). SAPK3/p38gamma binds preferentially to the third PDZ domain of SAP90 and phosphorylates residues Thr287 and Ser290 in vitro, and Ser290 in cells in response to cellular stresses. Phosphorylation of SAP90 is dependent on the binding of SAPK3/p38gamma to the PDZ domain of SAP90. It is not blocked by SB 203580, which inhibits SAPK2a/p38alpha and SAPK2b/p38beta but not SAPK3/p38gamma, or by the ERK pathway inhibitor PD 184352. However, phosphorylation is abolished when cells are treated with a cell-permeant Tat fusion peptide that disrupts the interaction of SAPK3/p38gamma with SAP90. ERK2 also phosphorylates SAP90 at Thr287 and Ser290 in vitro, but this does not require PDZ-dependent binding. SAP90 also becomes phosphorylated in response to mitogens, and this phosphorylation is prevented by pretreatment of the cells with PD 184352, but not with SB 203580. In neurons, SAP90 and SAPK3/p38gamma co-localize and they are co-immunoprecipitated from brain synaptic junctional preparations. These results demonstrate that SAP90 is a novel binding partner for SAPK3/p38gamma, a first physiological substrate described for SAPK3/p38gamma and a novel substrate for ERK1/ERK2, and that phosphorylation of SAP90 may play a role in regulating protein-protein interactions at the synapse in response to adverse stress- or mitogen-related stimuli.",

        "Abstract": "We have identified a new binding partner of the TGFbeta (transforming growth factor-beta)-activated protein kinase (TAK1), termed TAB3 (TAK1-binding protein-3), which shares 48% amino acid sequence identity with TAB2. Our results indicate that two distinct TAK1 complexes are present in cells. One comprises TAK1 complexed with TAB1 and TAB2, and the other TAK1 complexed with TAB1 and TAB3. Both complexes are activated in response to tumour necrosis factor-alpha or interleukin-1 in human epithelial KB cells or bacterial lipopolysaccharide in RAW264.7 macrophages, and are subject to feedback control by stress-activated protein kinase 2a (SAPK2a; also called p38alpha). The electrophoretic mobility of TAB2 and TAB3 decreases in response to these agonists or osmotic shock, and is reversed by treatment with protein phosphatase-1. The decrease in mobility of TAB3 is prevented if the cells are incubated with SB 203580 before stimulation, but treatment with SB 203580 produces forms of TAB2 with a mobility intermediate between that observed for TAB2 in unstimulated and stimulated cells. Similar results were obtained in embryonic fibroblasts from mice deficient in SAPK2a/p38alpha. Our results indicate that TAB3 is phosphorylated via the SAPK2a/p38alpha pathway, whereas TAB2 is phosphorylated at two or more sites by both an SAPK2a/p38alpha-dependent and an SB 203580-independent kinase. The SAPK2a/p38alpha-mediated phosphorylation of TAB2 and TAB3 may contribute to the SAPK2a/p38alpha-mediated feedback control of TAK1 activity that also involves the phosphorylation of TAB1. We also show that the agonist-induced activation of TAK1 complexes requires the phosphorylation of the TAK1 catalytic subunit at a serine/threonine residue(s).",

        "Abstract": "Eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2) kinase, the enzyme that inactivates eEF2, is controlled by phosphorylation. Previous work showed that stress-activated protein kinase 4 (SAPK4, also called p38delta) inhibits eEF2 kinase in vitro by phosphorylating Ser-359, while ribosomal protein S6 kinases inhibit eEF2 kinase by phosphorylating Ser-366 [Knebel, Morrice and Cohen (2001) EMBO J. 20, 4360-4369; Wang, Li, Williams, Terada, Alessi and Proud (2001) EMBO J. 20, 4370-4379]. In the present study we have examined the effects of the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) on the phosphorylation of eEF2 kinase. We demonstrate that Ser-359, Ser-366 and two novel sites (Ser-377 and Ser-396) are all phosphorylated in human epithelial KB cells, but only the phosphorylation of Ser-359 and Ser-377 increases in response to these agonists and correlates with the dephosphorylation (activation) of eEF2. Ser-377 is probably a substrate of MAPKAP-K2/K3 (mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase 2/kinase 3) in cells, because eEF2 kinase is phosphorylated efficiently by these protein kinases in vitro and phosphorylation of this site, induced by TNF-alpha and low (but not high) concentrations of anisomycin, is prevented by SB 203580, which inhibits SAPK2a/p38, their \"upstream\" activator. The phosphorylation of Ser-359 induced by high concentrations of anisomycin is probably catalysed by SAPK4/p38delta in cells, because no other stress-activated, proline-directed protein kinase tested phosphorylates this site in vitro and phosphorylation is insensitive to SB 203580. Interestingly, the phosphorylation of Ser-359 induced by TNF-alpha or low concentrations of anisomycin is suppressed by SB 203580, indicating that phosphorylation is also mediated by a novel pathway. Since the phosphorylation of Ser-377 does not inhibit eEF2 kinase in vitro, our results suggest that anisomycin or TNF-alpha inhibit eEF2 kinase via the phosphorylation of Ser-359.",

        "Abstract": "A widely expressed protein containing UBA (ubiquitin-associated) and UBX (ubiquitin-like) domains was identified as a substrate of SAPKs (stress-activated protein kinases). Termed SAKS1 (SAPK substrate-1), it was phosphorylated efficiently at Ser200 in vitro by SAPK3/p38gamma, SAPK4/p38delta and JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase), but weakly by SAPK2a/p38alpha, SAPK2b/p38beta2 or ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase) 2. Ser200, situated immediately N-terminal to the UBX domain, became phosphorylated in HEK-293 (human embryonic kidney) cells in response to stressors. Phosphorylation was not prevented by SB 203580 (an inhibitor of SAPK2a/p38alpha and SAPK2b/p38beta2) and/or PD 184352 (which inhibits the activation of ERK1 and ERK2), and was similar in fibroblasts lacking both SAPK3/p38gamma and SAPK4/p38delta or JNK1 and JNK2. SAKS1 bound ubiquitin tetramers and VCP (valosin-containing protein) in vitro via the UBA and UBX domains respectively. The amount of VCP in cell extracts that bound to immobilized GST (glutathione S-transferase)-SAKS1 was enhanced by elevating the level of polyubiquitinated proteins, while SAKS1 and VCP in extracts were coimmunoprecipitated with an antibody raised against S5a, a component of the 19 S proteasomal subunit that binds polyubiquitinated proteins. PNGase (peptide N-glycanase) formed a 1:1 complex with VCP and, for this reason, also bound to immobilized GST-SAKS1. We suggest that SAKS1 may be an adaptor that directs VCP to polyubiquitinated proteins, and PNGase to misfolded glycoproteins, facilitating their destruction by the proteasome.",

        "Abstract": "SAPK3 (stress-activated protein kinase-3, also known as p38gamma) is a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family; it phosphorylates substrates in response to cellular stress, and has been shown to bind through its C-terminal sequence to the PDZ domain of alpha1-syntrophin. In the present study, we show that SAP90 [(synapse-associated protein 90; also known as PSD-95 (postsynaptic density-95)] is a novel physiological substrate for both SAPK3/p38gamma and the ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated protein kinase). SAPK3/p38gamma binds preferentially to the third PDZ domain of SAP90 and phosphorylates residues Thr287 and Ser290 in vitro, and Ser290 in cells in response to cellular stresses. Phosphorylation of SAP90 is dependent on the binding of SAPK3/p38gamma to the PDZ domain of SAP90. It is not blocked by SB 203580, which inhibits SAPK2a/p38alpha and SAPK2b/p38beta but not SAPK3/p38gamma, or by the ERK pathway inhibitor PD 184352. However, phosphorylation is abolished when cells are treated with a cell-permeant Tat fusion peptide that disrupts the interaction of SAPK3/p38gamma with SAP90. ERK2 also phosphorylates SAP90 at Thr287 and Ser290 in vitro, but this does not require PDZ-dependent binding. SAP90 also becomes phosphorylated in response to mitogens, and this phosphorylation is prevented by pretreatment of the cells with PD 184352, but not with SB 203580. In neurons, SAP90 and SAPK3/p38gamma co-localize and they are co-immunoprecipitated from brain synaptic junctional preparations. These results demonstrate that SAP90 is a novel binding partner for SAPK3/p38gamma, a first physiological substrate described for SAPK3/p38gamma and a novel substrate for ERK1/ERK2, and that phosphorylation of SAP90 may play a role in regulating protein-protein interactions at the synapse in response to adverse stress- or mitogen-related stimuli.",

        "Abstract": "We have identified a new binding partner of the TGFbeta (transforming growth factor-beta)-activated protein kinase (TAK1), termed TAB3 (TAK1-binding protein-3), which shares 48% amino acid sequence identity with TAB2. Our results indicate that two distinct TAK1 complexes are present in cells. One comprises TAK1 complexed with TAB1 and TAB2, and the other TAK1 complexed with TAB1 and TAB3. Both complexes are activated in response to tumour necrosis factor-alpha or interleukin-1 in human epithelial KB cells or bacterial lipopolysaccharide in RAW264.7 macrophages, and are subject to feedback control by stress-activated protein kinase 2a (SAPK2a; also called p38alpha). The electrophoretic mobility of TAB2 and TAB3 decreases in response to these agonists or osmotic shock, and is reversed by treatment with protein phosphatase-1. The decrease in mobility of TAB3 is prevented if the cells are incubated with SB 203580 before stimulation, but treatment with SB 203580 produces forms of TAB2 with a mobility intermediate between that observed for TAB2 in unstimulated and stimulated cells. Similar results were obtained in embryonic fibroblasts from mice deficient in SAPK2a/p38alpha. Our results indicate that TAB3 is phosphorylated via the SAPK2a/p38alpha pathway, whereas TAB2 is phosphorylated at two or more sites by both an SAPK2a/p38alpha-dependent and an SB 203580-independent kinase. The SAPK2a/p38alpha-mediated phosphorylation of TAB2 and TAB3 may contribute to the SAPK2a/p38alpha-mediated feedback control of TAK1 activity that also involves the phosphorylation of TAB1.

        "Abstract": "Eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2) kinase, the enzyme that inactivates eEF2, is controlled by phosphorylation. Previous work showed that stress-activated protein kinase 4 (SAPK4, also called p38delta) inhibits eEF2 kinase in vitro by phosphorylating Ser-359, while ribosomal protein S6 kinases inhibit eEF2 kinase by phosphorylating Ser-366 [Knebel, Morrice and Cohen (2001) EMBO J. 20, 4360-4369; Wang, Li, Williams, Terada, Alessi and Proud (2001) EMBO J. 20, 4370-4379]. In the present study we have examined the effects of the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) on the phosphorylation of eEF2 kinase. We demonstrate that Ser-359, Ser-366 and two novel sites (Ser-377 and Ser-396) are all phosphorylated in human epithelial KB cells, but only the phosphorylation of Ser-359 and Ser-377 increases in response to these agonists and correlates with the dephosphorylation (activation) of eEF2. Ser-377 is probably a substrate of MAPKAP-K2/K3 (mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase 2/kinase 3) in cells, because eEF2 kinase is phosphorylated efficiently by these protein kinases in vitro and phosphorylation of this site, induced by TNF-alpha and low (but not high) concentrations of anisomycin, is prevented by SB 203580, which inhibits SAPK2a/p38, their \"upstream\" activator. The phosphorylation of Ser-359 induced by high concentrations of anisomycin is probably catalysed by SAPK4/p38delta in cells, because no other stress-activated, proline-directed protein kinase tested phosphorylates this site in vitro and phosphorylation is insensitive to SB 203580. Interestingly, the phosphorylation of Ser-359 induced by TNF-alpha or low concentrations of anisomycin is suppressed by SB 203580, indicating that phosphorylation is also mediated by a novel pathway. Since the phosphorylation of Ser-377 does not inhibit eEF2 kinase in vitro, our results suggest that anisomycin or TNF-alpha inhibit eEF2 kinase via the phosphorylation of Ser-359.",

        "Abstract": "SAPK3 (stress-activated protein kinase-3, also known as p38gamma) is a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family; it phosphorylates substrates in response to cellular stress, and has been shown to bind through its C-terminal sequence to the PDZ domain of alpha1-syntrophin. In the present study, we show that SAP90 [(synapse-associated protein 90; also known as PSD-95 (postsynaptic density-95)] is a novel physiological substrate for both SAPK3/p38gamma and the ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated protein kinase). SAPK3/p38gamma binds preferentially to the third PDZ domain of SAP90 and phosphorylates residues Thr287 and Ser290 in vitro, and Ser290 in cells in response to cellular stresses. Phosphorylation of SAP90 is dependent on the binding of SAPK3/p38gamma to the PDZ domain of SAP90. It is not blocked by SB 203580, which inhibits SAPK2a/p38alpha and SAPK2b/p38beta but not SAPK3/p38gamma, or by the ERK pathway inhibitor PD 184352. However, phosphorylation is abolished when cells are treated with a cell-permeant Tat fusion peptide that disrupts the interaction of SAPK3/p38gamma with SAP90. ERK2 also phosphorylates SAP90 at Thr287 and Ser290 in vitro, but this does not require PDZ-dependent binding. SAP90 also becomes phosphorylated in response to mitogens, and this phosphorylation is prevented by pretreatment of the cells with PD 184352, but not with SB 203580. In neurons, SAP90 and SAPK3/p38gamma co-localize and they are co-immunoprecipitated from brain synaptic junctional preparations. These results demonstrate that SAP90 is a novel binding partner for SAPK3/p38gamma, a first physiological substrate described for SAPK3/p38gamma and a novel substrate for ERK1/ERK2, and that phosphorylation of SAP90 may play a role in regulating protein-protein interactions at the synapse in response to adverse stress- or mitogen-related stimuli.",

        "Abstract": "We have identified a new binding partner of the TGFbeta (transforming growth factor-beta)-activated protein kinase (TAK1), termed TAB3 (TAK1-binding protein-3), which shares 48% amino acid sequence identity with TAB2. Our results indicate that two distinct TAK1 complexes are present in cells. One comprises TAK1 complexed with TAB1 and TAB2, and the other TAK1 complexed with TAB1 and TAB3. Both complexes are activated in response to tumour necrosis factor-alpha or interleukin-1 in human epithelial KB cells or bacterial lipopolysaccharide in RAW264.7 macrophages, and are subject to feedback control by stress-activated protein kinase 2a (SAPK2a; also called p38alpha). The electrophoretic mobility of TAB2 and TAB3 decreases in response to these agonists or osmotic shock, and is reversed by treatment with protein phosphatase-1. The decrease in mobility of TAB3 is prevented if the cells are incubated with SB 203580 before stimulation, but treatment with SB 203580 produces forms of TAB2 with a mobility intermediate between that observed for TAB2 in unstimulated and stimulated cells. Similar results were obtained in embryonic fibroblasts from mice deficient in SAPK2a/p38alpha. Our results indicate that TAB3 is phosphorylated via the SAPK2a/p38alpha pathway, whereas TAB2 is phosphorylated at two or more sites by both an SAPK2a/p38alpha-dependent and an SB 203580-independent kinase. The SAPK2a/p38alpha-mediated phosphorylation of TAB2 and TAB3 may contribute to the SAPK2a/p38alpha-mediated feedback control of TAK1 activity that also involves the phosphorylation of TAB1. We also show that the agonist-induced activation of TAK1 complexes requires the phosphorylation of the TAK1 catalytic subunit at a serine/threonine residue(s).",

        "Abstract": "Eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2) kinase, the enzyme that inactivates eEF2, is controlled by phosphorylation. Previous work showed that stress-activated protein kinase 4 (SAPK4, also called p38delta) inhibits eEF2 kinase in vitro by phosphorylating Ser-359, while ribosomal protein S6 kinases inhibit eEF2 kinase by phosphorylating Ser-366 [Knebel, Morrice and Cohen (2001) EMBO J. 20, 4360-4369; Wang, Li, Williams, Terada, Alessi and Proud (2001) EMBO J. 20, 4370-4379]. In the present study we have examined the effects of the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) on the phosphorylation of eEF2 kinase. We demonstrate that Ser-359, Ser-366 and two novel sites (Ser-377 and Ser-396) are all phosphorylated in human epithelial KB cells, but only the phosphorylation of Ser-359 and Ser-377 increases in response to these agonists and correlates with the dephosphorylation (activation) of eEF2. Ser-377 is probably a substrate of MAPKAP-K2/K3 (mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase 2/kinase 3) in cells, because eEF2 kinase is phosphorylated efficiently by these protein kinases in vitro and phosphorylation of this site, induced by TNF-alpha and low (but not high) concentrations of anisomycin, is prevented by SB 203580, which inhibits SAPK2a/p38, their \"upstream\" activator. The phosphorylation of Ser-359 induced by high concentrations of anisomycin is probably catalysed by SAPK4/p38delta in cells, because no other stress-activated, proline-directed protein kinase tested phosphorylates this site in vitro and phosphorylation is insensitive to SB 203580. Interestingly, the phosphorylation of Ser-359 induced by TNF-alpha or low concentrations of anisomycin is suppressed by SB 203580, indicating that phosphorylation is also mediated by a novel pathway. Since the phosphorylation of Ser-377 does not inhibit eEF2 kinase in vitro, our results suggest that anisomycin or TNF-alpha inhibit eEF2 kinase via the phosphorylation of Ser-359.",

These observations provide direct evidence of a skin-gut axis by demonstrating that damage to the skin disrupts homeostasis in intestinal host defense and alters the gut microbiome.",

In light of this, we present a selected review of clinical trials and preclinical studies targeting both the vaginal and gut microbiomes for the prevention or treatment of various gynecologic conditions. Specifically, we explore studies that leverage microbiota transplants, probiotics, prebiotics, diet modifications, and engineered microbial strains. A healthy vaginal microbiome for females of reproductive age consists of lactic acid-producing bacteria predominantly of the Lactobacillus genus, which serves as a protective barrier against pathogens and maintains a balanced ecosystem. The gut microbiota's production of short-chain fatty acids, metabolism of primary bile acids, and modulation of sex steroid levels have significant implications for the interplay between host and microbes throughout the body, ultimately impacting reproductive health. By harnessing interventions that modulate both the vaginal and gut microbiomes, it becomes possible to not only maintain homeostasis but also mitigate pathological conditions. While the field is still working toward making broad clinical recommendations, the current studies demonstrate that manipulating the microbiome holds great potential for addressing diverse gynecologic conditions.",

        "Abstract": "Cells have evolved mechanisms to distribute ~10 billion protein molecules to subcellular compartments where diverse proteins involved in shared functions must efficiently assemble. Here, we demonstrate that proteins with shared functions share amino acid sequence codes that guide them to compartment destinations. A protein language model, ProtGPS, was developed that predicts with high performance the compartment localization of human proteins excluded from the training set. ProtGPS successfully guided generation of novel protein sequences that selectively assemble in targeted subcellular compartments. ProtGPS also identified pathological mutations that change this code and lead to altered subcellular localization of proteins. Our results indicate that protein sequences contain not only a folding code, but also a previously unrecognized code governing their distribution in specific cellular compartments.",

These microbes can promote disease or have beneficial functions, leading to the hypothesis that microbes in the gut explain the co-occurrence of intestinal and skin diseases. Here, we show that the reverse can occur, and that skin directly alters the gut microbiome. Disruption of the dermis by skin wounding or the digestion of dermal hyaluronan results in increased expression in the colon of the host defense genes Reg3 and Muc2, and skin wounding changes the composition and behavior of intestinal bacteria. Enhanced expression Reg3 and Muc2 is induced in vitro by exposure to hyaluronan released by these skin interventions. The change in the colon microbiome after skin wounding is functionally important as these bacteria penetrate the intestinal epithelium and enhance colitis from dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) as seen by the ability to rescue skin associated DSS colitis with oral antibiotics, in germ-free mice, and fecal microbiome transplantation to unwounded mice from mice with skin wounds.

The peptides are nearly insoluble in water, but highly soluble in aqueous solutions containing 50% acetonitrile (pH 4.0).

Characterization of the peptides in solution by circular dichroism and NMR spectroscopy shows that the formation of these fibrils does not require specific preformed secondary structure in the solution state species. While the majority of the soluble fraction of each peptide is monomeric and unstructured, different types of structures including alpha-helical, beta-sheet, and random coil conformations are observed under conditions that eventually lead to fibril formation.

Because of the complexity of this regulatory puzzle, precise identification of the determinants that control hemoglobin switching has proven difficult. Phylogenetic footprinting is an evolutionary approach to this problem which is based on the supposition that the basic mechanisms of switching are conserved throughout mammalian phylogeny. Alignment of the 5' flanking regions of the gamma genes of several species allows the identification of footprints of 100% conserved sequence.

Further analysis reveals that the CSBP-1 binding activity is identical to that of a recently cloned zinc finger protein that has been shown to act as a repressor in other systems. The binding of CSPB-1 to silencer sequences in the epsilon and gamma globin genes may be important in the stage-specific silencing of these genes.",

Notably, a single injection of this self-therapeutic nanoparticle reduces tissue degeneration, inhibits genes related to the extracellular matrix, and treats fibrosis more effectively than standard Captopril therapy. Our data underscore the importance of constructing CKD nanomedicines based on renal pathophysiology.",

        "Abstract": "Essential functions of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) depend on their capacity to selectively phosphorylate a limited repertoire of substrates. MAPKs harbor a conserved groove located outside of the catalytic cleft that binds to short linear sequence motifs found in substrates and regulators. However, the weak and transient nature of these \"docking\" interactions poses a challenge to defining MAPK interactomes and associated sequence motifs. Here, we describe a yeast-based genetic screening pipeline to evaluate large collections of MAPK docking sequences in parallel. Using this platform, we analyzed a combinatorial library based on the docking sequences from the MAPK kinases MKK6 and MKK7, defining features critical for binding to the stress-activated MAPKs JNK1 and p38α. Our screen of a library consisting of ~12,000 sequences from the human proteome revealed multiple MAPK-selective interactors, including many that did not conform to previously defined docking motifs. Analysis of p38α/JNK1 exchange mutants identified specific docking groove residues that mediate selective binding. Last, we verified that docking sequences identified in the screen functioned in substrate recruitment in vitro and in cultured cells. Together, these studies establish an approach to characterize MAPK docking sequences and provide a resource for future investigation of signaling downstream of p38 and JNK.",

Mitogen-activated protein kinases (p38 MAPKs) are key protein kinases involved in the production of inflammatory mediators, including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). p38 MAPK signaling plays an important role in the regulation of cellular processes, especially inflammation.

Lansoprazole has been reported to provide hepatoprotection in a drug-induced hepatitis animal model through the Nrf2/heme oxygenase-1 (HO1) pathway. We sought to investigate the molecular mechanism of cytoprotection by lansoprazole. An in vitro experimental model was conducted using cultured rat hepatic cells treated with lansoprazole to analyze the expression levels of Nrf2 and its downstream genes, the activity of Nrf2 using luciferase reporter assays, cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity, and signaling pathways involved in Nrf2 activation. Lansoprazole treatment of rat liver epithelial RL34 cells induced transactivation of Nrf2 and the expression of the Nrf2-dependent antioxidant genes encoding HO1, NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase-1, and glutathione S-transferase A2. Furthermore, cycloheximide chase experiments revealed that lansoprazole prolongs the half-life of the Nrf2 protein. Notably, cell viability was significantly increased by lansoprazole treatment in a cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity model. Moreover, the siRNA knockdown of Nrf2 fully abolished the cytoprotective effect of lansoprazole, whereas the inhibition of HO1 by tin-mesoporphyrin only partially abolished this. Finally, lansoprazole promoted the phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) but not that of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase or the c-Jun N-terminal kinase. Using SB203580, a specific inhibitor for p38 MAPK, the lansoprazole-induced Nrf2/antioxidant response elements pathway activation and cytoprotective effects were shown to be exclusively p38 MAPK dependent. Lansoprazole was shown by these results to exert a cytoprotective effect on liver epithelial cells against the cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity through the p38 MAPK signaling pathway.

        "Abstract": "Lansoprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, can exert antioxidant effects through the induction of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway, independently of the inhibition of acid secretion in the gastrointestinal tract. Lansoprazole has been reported to provide hepatoprotection in a drug-induced hepatitis animal model through the Nrf2/heme oxygenase-1 (HO1) pathway. We sought to investigate the molecular mechanism of cytoprotection by lansoprazole. An in vitro experimental model was conducted using cultured rat hepatic cells treated with lansoprazole to analyze the expression levels of Nrf2 and its downstream genes, the activity of Nrf2 using luciferase reporter assays, cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity, and signaling pathways involved in Nrf2 activation. Lansoprazole treatment of rat liver epithelial RL34 cells induced transactivation of Nrf2 and the expression of the Nrf2-dependent antioxidant genes encoding HO1, NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase-1, and glutathione S-transferase A2. Furthermore, cycloheximide chase experiments revealed that lansoprazole prolongs the half-life of the Nrf2 protein. Notably, cell viability was significantly increased by lansoprazole treatment in a cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity model. Moreover, the siRNA knockdown of Nrf2 fully abolished the cytoprotective effect of lansoprazole, whereas the inhibition of HO1 by tin-mesoporphyrin only partially abolished this. Finally, lansoprazole promoted the phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) but not that of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase or the c-Jun N-terminal kinase. Using SB203580, a specific inhibitor for p38 MAPK, the lansoprazole-induced Nrf2/antioxidant response elements pathway activation and cytoprotective effects were shown to be exclusively p38 MAPK dependent. Lansoprazole was shown by these results to exert a cytoprotective effect on liver epithelial cells against the cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity through the p38 MAPK signaling pathway. This could have potential applications for the prevention and treatment of oxidative injury in the liver.",

        "Abstract": "Soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) is an enzyme involved in the metabolism of bioactive lipid signaling molecules. sEH converts epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EET) to virtually inactive dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids (DHET). The first acids are \"medicinal\" molecules, the second increase the inflammatory infiltration of cells. Mitogen-activated protein kinases (p38 MAPKs) are key protein kinases involved in the production of inflammatory mediators, including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). p38 MAPK signaling plays an important role in the regulation of cellular processes, especially inflammation. The proto-oncogenic serine/threonine protein kinase Raf (c-Raf) is a major component of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway: ERK1/2 signaling. Normal cellular Raf genes can also mutate and become oncogenes, overloading the activity of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2. The development of multitarget inhibitors is a promising strategy for the treatment of socially dangerous diseases. We synthesized 1,3-disubstituted ureas and diureas containing a dichloroadamantyl moiety. The results of computational methods show that soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibitors can act on two more targets in different signaling pathways of mitogen-activated protein kinases p38 MAPK and c-Raf. The two chlorine atoms in the adamantyl moiety may provide additional Cl-π interactions in the active site of human sEH. Molecular dynamics studies have shown that the stability of ligand-protein complexes largely depends on the \"spacer effect.\" The compound containing a bridge between the chloroadamantyl fragment and the ureide group forms more stable ligand-protein complexes with sEH and p38 MAPK, which indicates a better conformational ability of the molecule in the active sites of these targets. In turn, a compound containing two chlorine atoms forms a more stable complex with c-Raf, probably due to the presence of additional halogen bonds of chlorine atoms with amino acid residues.",

        "Abstract": "A widely expressed protein containing UBA (ubiquitin-associated) and UBX (ubiquitin-like) domains was identified as a substrate of SAPKs (stress-activated protein kinases). Termed SAKS1 (SAPK substrate-1), it was phosphorylated efficiently at Ser200 in vitro by SAPK3/p38gamma, SAPK4/p38delta and JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase), but weakly by SAPK2a/p38alpha, SAPK2b/p38beta2 or ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase) 2. Ser200, situated immediately N-terminal to the UBX domain, became phosphorylated in HEK-293 (human embryonic kidney) cells in response to stressors. Phosphorylation was not prevented by SB 203580 (an inhibitor of SAPK2a/p38alpha and SAPK2b/p38beta2) and/or PD 184352 (which inhibits the activation of ERK1 and ERK2), and was similar in fibroblasts lacking both SAPK3/p38gamma and SAPK4/p38delta or JNK1 and JNK2. SAKS1 bound ubiquitin tetramers and VCP (valosin-containing protein) in vitro via the UBA and UBX domains respectively. The amount of VCP in cell extracts that bound to immobilized GST (glutathione S-transferase)-SAKS1 was enhanced by elevating the level of polyubiquitinated proteins, while SAKS1 and VCP in extracts were coimmunoprecipitated with an antibody raised against S5a, a component of the 19 S proteasomal subunit that binds polyubiquitinated proteins. PNGase (peptide N-glycanase) formed a 1:1 complex with VCP and, for this reason, also bound to immobilized GST-SAKS1. We suggest that SAKS1 may be an adaptor that directs VCP to polyubiquitinated proteins, and PNGase to misfolded glycoproteins, facilitating their destruction by the proteasome.",

        "Abstract": "SAPK3 (stress-activated protein kinase-3, also known as p38gamma) is a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family; it phosphorylates substrates in response to cellular stress, and has been shown to bind through its C-terminal sequence to the PDZ domain of alpha1-syntrophin. In the present study, we show that SAP90 [(synapse-associated protein 90; also known as PSD-95 (postsynaptic density-95)] is a novel physiological substrate for both SAPK3/p38gamma and the ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated protein kinase). SAPK3/p38gamma binds preferentially to the third PDZ domain of SAP90 and phosphorylates residues Thr287 and Ser290 in vitro, and Ser290 in cells in response to cellular stresses. Phosphorylation of SAP90 is dependent on the binding of SAPK3/p38gamma to the PDZ domain of SAP90. It is not blocked by SB 203580, which inhibits SAPK2a/p38alpha and SAPK2b/p38beta but not SAPK3/p38gamma, or by the ERK pathway inhibitor PD 184352. However, phosphorylation is abolished when cells are treated with a cell-permeant Tat fusion peptide that disrupts the interaction of SAPK3/p38gamma with SAP90. ERK2 also phosphorylates SAP90 at Thr287 and Ser290 in vitro, but this does not require PDZ-dependent binding. SAP90 also becomes phosphorylated in response to mitogens, and this phosphorylation is prevented by pretreatment of the cells with PD 184352, but not with SB 203580. In neurons, SAP90 and SAPK3/p38gamma co-localize and they are co-immunoprecipitated from brain synaptic junctional preparations. These results demonstrate that SAP90 is a novel binding partner for SAPK3/p38gamma, a first physiological substrate described for SAPK3/p38gamma and a novel substrate for ERK1/ERK2, and that phosphorylation of SAP90 may play a role in regulating protein-protein interactions at the synapse in response to adverse stress- or mitogen-related stimuli.",

        "Abstract": "We have identified a new binding partner of the TGFbeta (transforming growth factor-beta)-activated protein kinase (TAK1), termed TAB3 (TAK1-binding protein-3), which shares 48% amino acid sequence identity with TAB2. Our results indicate that two distinct TAK1 complexes are present in cells. One comprises TAK1 complexed with TAB1 and TAB2, and the other TAK1 complexed with TAB1 and TAB3. Both complexes are activated in response to tumour necrosis factor-alpha or interleukin-1 in human epithelial KB cells or bacterial lipopolysaccharide in RAW264.7 macrophages, and are subject to feedback control by stress-activated protein kinase 2a (SAPK2a; also called p38alpha). The electrophoretic mobility of TAB2 and TAB3 decreases in response to these agonists or osmotic shock, and is reversed by treatment with protein phosphatase-1. The decrease in mobility of TAB3 is prevented if the cells are incubated with SB 203580 before stimulation, but treatment with SB 203580 produces forms of TAB2 with a mobility intermediate between that observed for TAB2 in unstimulated and stimulated cells. Similar results were obtained in embryonic fibroblasts from mice deficient in SAPK2a/p38alpha. Our results indicate that TAB3 is phosphorylated via the SAPK2a/p38alpha pathway, whereas TAB2 is phosphorylated at two or more sites by both an SAPK2a/p38alpha-dependent and an SB 203580-independent kinase. The SAPK2a/p38alpha-mediated phosphorylation of TAB2 and TAB3 may contribute to the SAPK2a/p38alpha-mediated feedback control of TAK1 activity that also involves the phosphorylation of TAB1. We also show that the agonist-induced activation of TAK1 complexes requires the phosphorylation of the TAK1 catalytic subunit at a serine/threonine residue(s).",

        "Abstract": "Eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2) kinase, the enzyme that inactivates eEF2, is controlled by phosphorylation. Previous work showed that stress-activated protein kinase 4 (SAPK4, also called p38delta) inhibits eEF2 kinase in vitro by phosphorylating Ser-359, while ribosomal protein S6 kinases inhibit eEF2 kinase by phosphorylating Ser-366 [Knebel, Morrice and Cohen (2001) EMBO J. 20, 4360-4369; Wang, Li, Williams, Terada, Alessi and Proud (2001) EMBO J. 20, 4370-4379]. In the present study we have examined the effects of the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) on the phosphorylation of eEF2 kinase. We demonstrate that Ser-359, Ser-366 and two novel sites (Ser-377 and Ser-396) are all phosphorylated in human epithelial KB cells, but only the phosphorylation of Ser-359 and Ser-377 increases in response to these agonists and correlates with the dephosphorylation (activation) of eEF2. Ser-377 is probably a substrate of MAPKAP-K2/K3 (mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase 2/kinase 3) in cells, because eEF2 kinase is phosphorylated efficiently by these protein kinases in vitro and phosphorylation of this site, induced by TNF-alpha and low (but not high) concentrations of anisomycin, is prevented by SB 203580, which inhibits SAPK2a/p38, their \"upstream\" activator. The phosphorylation of Ser-359 induced by high concentrations of anisomycin is probably catalysed by SAPK4/p38delta in cells, because no other stress-activated, proline-directed protein kinase tested phosphorylates this site in vitro and phosphorylation is insensitive to SB 203580. Interestingly, the phosphorylation of Ser-359 induced by TNF-alpha or low concentrations of anisomycin is suppressed by SB 203580, indicating that phosphorylation is also mediated by a novel pathway. Since the phosphorylation of Ser-377 does not inhibit eEF2 kinase in vitro, our results suggest that anisomycin or TNF-alpha inhibit eEF2 kinase via the phosphorylation of Ser-359.",

The phosphorylation is prevented by SB 203580, an inhibitor of SAPK2a (stress-activated protein kinase 2a)/p38a and SAPK2b/p38b, and does not occur in embryonic fibroblasts generated from SAPK2a/p38a-deficient mice. Nogo-B is phosphorylated at Ser107 in vitro by MAPKAP-K2 [MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase)-activated protein kinase-2] or MAPKAP-K3, but not by other protein kinases that are known to be activated by SAPK2a/p38a. The anisomycin-induced phosphorylation of Ser107 in HeLa cells can be prevented by 'knockdown' of MAPKAP-K2 using siRNA (small interfering RNA). Taken together, our results identify Nogo-B as a new physiological substrate of MAPKAP-K2.",

        "Abstract": "A widely expressed protein containing UBA (ubiquitin-associated) and UBX (ubiquitin-like) domains was identified as a substrate of SAPKs (stress-activated protein kinases). Termed SAKS1 (SAPK substrate-1), it was phosphorylated efficiently at Ser200 in vitro by SAPK3/p38gamma, SAPK4/p38delta and JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase), but weakly by SAPK2a/p38alpha, SAPK2b/p38beta2 or ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase) 2.

SAKS1 bound ubiquitin tetramers and VCP (valosin-containing protein) in vitro via the UBA and UBX domains respectively. The amount of VCP in cell extracts that bound to immobilized GST (glutathione S-transferase)-SAKS1 was enhanced by elevating the level of polyubiquitinated proteins, while SAKS1 and VCP in extracts were coimmunoprecipitated with an antibody raised against S5a, a component of the 19 S proteasomal subunit that binds polyubiquitinated proteins. PNGase (peptide N-glycanase) formed a 1:1 complex with VCP and, for this reason, also bound to immobilized GST-SAKS1.

        "Abstract": "SAPK3 (stress-activated protein kinase-3, also known as p38gamma) is a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family; it phosphorylates substrates in response to cellular stress, and has been shown to bind through its C-terminal sequence to the PDZ domain of alpha1-syntrophin. In the present study, we show that SAP90 [(synapse-associated protein 90; also known as PSD-95 (postsynaptic density-95)] is a novel physiological substrate for both SAPK3/p38gamma and the ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated protein kinase). SAPK3/p38gamma binds preferentially to the third PDZ domain of SAP90 and phosphorylates residues Thr287 and Ser290 in vitro, and Ser290 in cells in response to cellular stresses. Phosphorylation of SAP90 is dependent on the binding of SAPK3/p38gamma to the PDZ domain of SAP90. It is not blocked by SB 203580, which inhibits SAPK2a/p38alpha and SAPK2b/p38beta but not SAPK3/p38gamma, or by the ERK pathway inhibitor PD 184352. However, phosphorylation is abolished when cells are treated with a cell-permeant Tat fusion peptide that disrupts the interaction of SAPK3/p38gamma with SAP90. ERK2 also phosphorylates SAP90 at Thr287 and Ser290 in vitro, but this does not require PDZ-dependent binding. SAP90 also becomes phosphorylated in response to mitogens, and this phosphorylation is prevented by pretreatment of the cells with PD 184352, but not with SB 203580. In neurons, SAP90 and SAPK3/p38gamma co-localize and they are co-immunoprecipitated from brain synaptic junctional preparations. These results demonstrate that SAP90 is a novel binding partner for SAPK3/p38gamma, a first physiological substrate described for SAPK3/p38gamma and a novel substrate for ERK1/ERK2, and that phosphorylation of SAP90 may play a role in regulating protein-protein interactions at the synapse in response to adverse stress- or mitogen-related stimuli.",

Our results indicate that two distinct TAK1 complexes are present in cells. One comprises TAK1 complexed with TAB1 and TAB2, and the other TAK1 complexed with TAB1 and TAB3. Both complexes are activated in response to tumour necrosis factor-alpha or interleukin-1 in human epithelial KB cells or bacterial lipopolysaccharide in RAW264.7 macrophages, and are subject to feedback control by stress-activated protein kinase 2a (SAPK2a; also called p38alpha). The electrophoretic mobility of TAB2 and TAB3 decreases in response to these agonists or osmotic shock, and is reversed by treatment with protein phosphatase-1. The decrease in mobility of TAB3 is prevented if the cells are incubated with SB 203580 before stimulation, but treatment with SB 203580 produces forms of TAB2 with a mobility intermediate between that observed for TAB2 in unstimulated and stimulated cells. Similar results were obtained in embryonic fibroblasts from mice deficient in SAPK2a/p38alpha. Our results indicate that TAB3 is phosphorylated via the SAPK2a/p38alpha pathway, whereas TAB2 is phosphorylated at two or more sites by both an SAPK2a/p38alpha-dependent and an SB 203580-independent kinase. The SAPK2a/p38alpha-mediated phosphorylation of TAB2 and TAB3 may contribute to the SAPK2a/p38alpha-mediated feedback control of TAK1 activity that also involves the phosphorylation of TAB1.

Previous work showed that stress-activated protein kinase 4 (SAPK4, also called p38delta) inhibits eEF2 kinase in vitro by phosphorylating Ser-359, while ribosomal protein S6 kinases inhibit eEF2 kinase by phosphorylating Ser-366 [Knebel, Morrice and Cohen (2001) EMBO J. 20, 4360-4369; Wang, Li, Williams, Terada, Alessi and Proud (2001) EMBO J. 20, 4370-4379]. In the present study we have examined the effects of the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) on the phosphorylation of eEF2 kinase. We demonstrate that Ser-359, Ser-366 and two novel sites (Ser-377 and Ser-396) are all phosphorylated in human epithelial KB cells, but only the phosphorylation of Ser-359 and Ser-377 increases in response to these agonists and correlates with the dephosphorylation (activation) of eEF2. Ser-377 is probably a substrate of MAPKAP-K2/K3 (mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase 2/kinase 3) in cells, because eEF2 kinase is phosphorylated efficiently by these protein kinases in vitro and phosphorylation of this site, induced by TNF-alpha and low (but not high) concentrations of anisomycin, is prevented by SB 203580, which inhibits SAPK2a/p38, their \"upstream\" activator. The phosphorylation of Ser-359 induced by high concentrations of anisomycin is probably catalysed by SAPK4/p38delta in cells, because no other stress-activated, proline-directed protein kinase tested phosphorylates this site in vitro and phosphorylation is insensitive to SB 203580. Interestingly, the phosphorylation of Ser-359 induced by TNF-alpha or low concentrations of anisomycin is suppressed by SB 203580, indicating that phosphorylation is also mediated by a novel pathway. Since the phosphorylation of Ser-377 does not inhibit eEF2 kinase in vitro, our results suggest that anisomycin or TNF-alpha inhibit eEF2 kinase via the phosphorylation of Ser-359.",

Phosphorylation was not prevented by SB 203580 (an inhibitor of SAPK2a/p38alpha and SAPK2b/p38beta2) and/or PD 184352 (which inhibits the activation of ERK1 and ERK2), and was similar in fibroblasts lacking both SAPK3/p38gamma and SAPK4/p38delta or JNK1 and JNK2. SAKS1 bound ubiquitin tetramers and VCP (valosin-containing protein) in vitro via the UBA and UBX domains respectively. The amount of VCP in cell extracts that bound to immobilized GST (glutathione S-transferase)-SAKS1 was enhanced by elevating the level of polyubiquitinated proteins, while SAKS1 and VCP in extracts were coimmunoprecipitated with an antibody raised against S5a, a component of the 19 S proteasomal subunit that binds polyubiquitinated proteins. PNGase (peptide N-glycanase) formed a 1:1 complex with VCP and, for this reason, also bound to immobilized GST-SAKS1. We suggest that SAKS1 may be an adaptor that directs VCP to polyubiquitinated proteins, and PNGase to misfolded glycoproteins, facilitating their destruction by the proteasome.",

        "Abstract": "SAPK3 (stress-activated protein kinase-3, also known as p38gamma) is a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family; it phosphorylates substrates in response to cellular stress, and has been shown to bind through its C-terminal sequence to the PDZ domain of alpha1-syntrophin. In the present study, we show that SAP90 [(synapse-associated protein 90; also known as PSD-95 (postsynaptic density-95)] is a novel physiological substrate for both SAPK3/p38gamma and the ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated protein kinase). SAPK3/p38gamma binds preferentially to the third PDZ domain of SAP90 and phosphorylates residues Thr287 and Ser290 in vitro, and Ser290 in cells in response to cellular stresses. Phosphorylation of SAP90 is dependent on the binding of SAPK3/p38gamma to the PDZ domain of SAP90. It is not blocked by SB 203580, which inhibits SAPK2a/p38alpha and SAPK2b/p38beta but not SAPK3/p38gamma, or by the ERK pathway inhibitor PD 184352. However, phosphorylation is abolished when cells are treated with a cell-permeant Tat fusion peptide that disrupts the interaction of SAPK3/p38gamma with SAP90. ERK2 also phosphorylates SAP90 at Thr287 and Ser290 in vitro, but this does not require PDZ-dependent binding. SAP90 also becomes phosphorylated in response to mitogens, and this phosphorylation is prevented by pretreatment of the cells with PD 184352, but not with SB 203580. In neurons, SAP90 and SAPK3/p38gamma co-localize and they are co-immunoprecipitated from brain synaptic junctional preparations. These results demonstrate that SAP90 is a novel binding partner for SAPK3/p38gamma, a first physiological substrate described for SAPK3/p38gamma and a novel substrate for ERK1/ERK2, and that phosphorylation of SAP90 may play a role in regulating protein-protein interactions at the synapse in response to adverse stress- or mitogen-related stimuli.",

        "Abstract": "We have identified a new binding partner of the TGFbeta (transforming growth factor-beta)-activated protein kinase (TAK1), termed TAB3 (TAK1-binding protein-3), which shares 48% amino acid sequence identity with TAB2. Our results indicate that two distinct TAK1 complexes are present in cells. One comprises TAK1 complexed with TAB1 and TAB2, and the other TAK1 complexed with TAB1 and TAB3. Both complexes are activated in response to tumour necrosis factor-alpha or interleukin-1 in human epithelial KB cells or bacterial lipopolysaccharide in RAW264.7 macrophages, and are subject to feedback control by stress-activated protein kinase 2a (SAPK2a; also called p38alpha). The electrophoretic mobility of TAB2 and TAB3 decreases in response to these agonists or osmotic shock, and is reversed by treatment with protein phosphatase-1. The decrease in mobility of TAB3 is prevented if the cells are incubated with SB 203580 before stimulation, but treatment with SB 203580 produces forms of TAB2 with a mobility intermediate between that observed for TAB2 in unstimulated and stimulated cells. Similar results were obtained in embryonic fibroblasts from mice deficient in SAPK2a/p38alpha. Our results indicate that TAB3 is phosphorylated via the SAPK2a/p38alpha pathway, whereas TAB2 is phosphorylated at two or more sites by both an SAPK2a/p38alpha-dependent and an SB 203580-independent kinase. The SAPK2a/p38alpha-mediated phosphorylation of TAB2 and TAB3 may contribute to the SAPK2a/p38alpha-mediated feedback control of TAK1 activity that also involves the phosphorylation of TAB1. We also show that the agonist-induced activation of TAK1 complexes requires the phosphorylation of the TAK1 catalytic subunit at a serine/threonine residue(s).",

        "Abstract": "Eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2) kinase, the enzyme that inactivates eEF2, is controlled by phosphorylation. Previous work showed that stress-activated protein kinase 4 (SAPK4, also called p38delta) inhibits eEF2 kinase in vitro by phosphorylating Ser-359, while ribosomal protein S6 kinases inhibit eEF2 kinase by phosphorylating Ser-366 [Knebel, Morrice and Cohen (2001) EMBO J. 20, 4360-4369; Wang, Li, Williams, Terada, Alessi and Proud (2001) EMBO J. 20, 4370-4379]. In the present study we have examined the effects of the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) on the phosphorylation of eEF2 kinase. We demonstrate that Ser-359, Ser-366 and two novel sites (Ser-377 and Ser-396) are all phosphorylated in human epithelial KB cells, but only the phosphorylation of Ser-359 and Ser-377 increases in response to these agonists and correlates with the dephosphorylation (activation) of eEF2. Ser-377 is probably a substrate of MAPKAP-K2/K3 (mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase 2/kinase 3) in cells, because eEF2 kinase is phosphorylated efficiently by these protein kinases in vitro and phosphorylation of this site, induced by TNF-alpha and low (but not high) concentrations of anisomycin, is prevented by SB 203580, which inhibits SAPK2a/p38, their \"upstream\" activator. The phosphorylation of Ser-359 induced by high concentrations of anisomycin is probably catalysed by SAPK4/p38delta in cells, because no other stress-activated, proline-directed protein kinase tested phosphorylates this site in vitro and phosphorylation is insensitive to SB 203580. Interestingly, the phosphorylation of Ser-359 induced by TNF-alpha or low concentrations of anisomycin is suppressed by SB 203580, indicating that phosphorylation is also mediated by a novel pathway. Since the phosphorylation of Ser-377 does not inhibit eEF2 kinase in vitro, our results suggest that anisomycin or TNF-alpha inhibit eEF2 kinase via the phosphorylation of Ser-359.",

        "Abstract": "Lansoprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, can exert antioxidant effects through the induction of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway, independently of the inhibition of acid secretion in the gastrointestinal tract. Lansoprazole has been reported to provide hepatoprotection in a drug-induced hepatitis animal model through the Nrf2/heme oxygenase-1 (HO1) pathway. We sought to investigate the molecular mechanism of cytoprotection by lansoprazole. An in vitro experimental model was conducted using cultured rat hepatic cells treated with lansoprazole to analyze the expression levels of Nrf2 and its downstream genes, the activity of Nrf2 using luciferase reporter assays, cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity, and signaling pathways involved in Nrf2 activation. Lansoprazole treatment of rat liver epithelial RL34 cells induced transactivation of Nrf2 and the expression of the Nrf2-dependent antioxidant genes encoding HO1, NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase-1, and glutathione S-transferase A2. Furthermore, cycloheximide chase experiments revealed that lansoprazole prolongs the half-life of the Nrf2 protein. Notably, cell viability was significantly increased by lansoprazole treatment in a cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity model. Moreover, the siRNA knockdown of Nrf2 fully abolished the cytoprotective effect of lansoprazole, whereas the inhibition of HO1 by tin-mesoporphyrin only partially abolished this. Finally, lansoprazole promoted the phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) but not that of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase or the c-Jun N-terminal kinase. Using SB203580, a specific inhibitor for p38 MAPK, the lansoprazole-induced Nrf2/antioxidant response elements pathway activation and cytoprotective effects were shown to be exclusively p38 MAPK dependent. Lansoprazole was shown by these results to exert a cytoprotective effect on liver epithelial cells against the cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity through the p38 MAPK signaling pathway. This could have potential applications for the prevention and treatment of oxidative injury in the liver.",

Lansoprazole has been reported to provide hepatoprotection in a drug-induced hepatitis animal model through the Nrf2/heme oxygenase-1 (HO1) pathway. We sought to investigate the molecular mechanism of cytoprotection by lansoprazole. An in vitro experimental model was conducted using cultured rat hepatic cells treated with lansoprazole to analyze the expression levels of Nrf2 and its downstream genes, the activity of Nrf2 using luciferase reporter assays, cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity, and signaling pathways involved in Nrf2 activation. Lansoprazole treatment of rat liver epithelial RL34 cells induced transactivation of Nrf2 and the expression of the Nrf2-dependent antioxidant genes encoding HO1, NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase-1, and glutathione S-transferase A2. Furthermore, cycloheximide chase experiments revealed that lansoprazole prolongs the half-life of the Nrf2 protein. Notably, cell viability was significantly increased by lansoprazole treatment in a cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity model. Moreover, the siRNA knockdown of Nrf2 fully abolished the cytoprotective effect of lansoprazole, whereas the inhibition of HO1 by tin-mesoporphyrin only partially abolished this. Finally, lansoprazole promoted the phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) but not that of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase or the c-Jun N-terminal kinase. Using SB203580, a specific inhibitor for p38 MAPK, the lansoprazole-induced Nrf2/antioxidant response elements pathway activation and cytoprotective effects were shown to be exclusively p38 MAPK dependent. Lansoprazole was shown by these results to exert a cytoprotective effect on liver epithelial cells against the cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity through the p38 MAPK signaling pathway.

We studied 84 children, aged from 6 to 18 years: 50 obese subjects, versus 34 of normal weight. Clinical examination involved: BMI, waist circumference, waist-to-height ratio, and detection of the presence of acanthosis nigricans and irregular menstrual cycles (the latter in adolescent girls). The carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) was measured with the Aixplorer MACH 30 echography device. The pulse wave velocity (PWV), augmentation index (AIx), and peripheral and central blood pressures (i.e., SBP, DBP, cSBP, cDBP, and cPP) were acquired through a Mobil-O-Graph device. Obese subjects underwent body composition analysis with a Tanita BC-418. Blood tests were: HOMA-IR, lipid panel, uric acid, and 25-OH vitamin D. All vascular biomarkers presented increased values in obese subjects versus controls. The following cut-off values were significant in detecting obesity: for PWV > 4.6 m/s, cSBP > 106 mmHg for the <12-year-olds, PWV > 4.5 m/s and cSBP > 115 mmHg for the 12-15-year-olds, and PWV > 5 m/s, cSBP > 123 mmHg for the >15-year-olds. AIx is higher in obese children, regardless of their insulin resistance status. Waist circumference and waist-to-height ratio correlate to all vascular parameters. HOMA-IR is an independent predictor for all vascular parameters except CIMT. Cut-off values for PWV of >4.8 m/s, SBP > 125 mmHg, and a cSBP > 117 mmHg predicted the presence of acanthosis nigricans. Obese girls with irregular menses displayed significantly higher PWV, SBP, and DPB. Elevated levels of uric acid, LDL-c, non-LDL-c, triglycerides, and transaminases, and low levels of HDL-c and 25-OH vitamin D correlated with higher arterial stiffness and CIMT values. We conclude that CIMT and the markers of arterial stiffness are useful in the early detection of vascular damage in obese children.",

Compared with CD47, the novel immune checkpoint CD24/Siglec-10 can also deliver 'don't eat me' signal and CD24 shows much lower expression level in normal tissue which might avoid unwanted side effects.",

Overcoming the shortcomings of antioxidants in IVDD treatment, including instability and the lack of targeting, remains challenging. Microfluidic and surface modification technologies were combined to graft chitosan nanoparticles encapsulated with strong reductive black phosphorus quantum dots (BPQDs) onto GelMA microspheres via amide bonds to construct oxygen metabolism-balanced engineered hydrogel microspheres (GM@CS-BP), which attenuate extracellular acidosis in nucleus pulposus (NP), block the inflammatory cascade, reduce matrix metalloproteinase expression (MMP), and remodel the extracellular matrix (ECM) in intervertebral discs (IVDs).
