In this study, we analyzed the clinical and laboratory characteristics of 30 convalescent HFRS patients 14 years after the disease contraction, mainly emphasizing several endothelial dysfunction parameters. Convalescent HFRS patients exhibited significantly higher serum levels of erythrocyte sedimentation rate, von Willebrand factor, uric acid, C-reactive protein and immunoglobulin A when compared to healthy individuals. Furthermore, 24 h urine analyses revealed significantly lower sodium and potassium urine levels, as well as significantly higher proteinuria, microalbumin levels and β2-microglobulin levels when compared to healthy individuals. First morning urine analysis revealed significantly higher levels of hematuria in convalescent HFRS patients. None of the additional analyzed endothelium dysfunction markers were significantly different in post-HFRS patients and healthy individuals, including serum and urine P-selectin, E-selectin, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1, vascular intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (sVCAM-1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). However, binary logistic regression revealed a weak association of serum sVCAM-1 and urine VEGF levels with HFRS contraction.

        "Abstract": "Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most common types of cancer in women in the United Arab Emirates. Immunogenic tumours, such as triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), show increased neutrophil infiltration, which is associated with poor prognosis and limited efficacy of immunotherapy. This study aims to investigate in vitro the bidirectional effect of neutrophils on metastatic TNBC (MDA-MB-231) compared to less-metastatic luminal breast cancer (MCF-7) cell lines. We found that BC cells or their conditioned medium (CM) reduced the viability of neutrophil-like cells (HL60). This was supported by increased cellular stress and NETosis in differentiated HL60 cells (dHL60) upon exposure to MDA-MB-231 compared to MCF-7-CM using nucleic acid staining essays. Flow cytometry showed comparable expression of inflammatory markers by polymorphonuclear cells (PMN) when treated with MDA-MB-231-CM and standard polarizing cocktails. Furthermore, MDA-MB-231-CM triggered an inflammatory pattern with evidence of stronger adhesion (CD62L) and degranulation (CD11b and CD66b) phenotypes. The proinflammatory polarization of dHL60 by MDA-MB-231-CM was additionally confirmed by the elevated CD54 expression, myeloperoxidase, and CD11b protein levels, which matched an increased transwell migratory capacity.

        "Abstract": "Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most common types of cancer in women in the United Arab Emirates. Immunogenic tumours, such as triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), show increased neutrophil infiltration, which is associated with poor prognosis and limited efficacy of immunotherapy. This study aims to investigate in vitro the bidirectional effect of neutrophils on metastatic TNBC (MDA-MB-231) compared to less-metastatic luminal breast cancer (MCF-7) cell lines. We found that BC cells or their conditioned medium (CM) reduced the viability of neutrophil-like cells (HL60). This was supported by increased cellular stress and NETosis in differentiated HL60 cells (dHL60) upon exposure to MDA-MB-231 compared to MCF-7-CM using nucleic acid staining essays.

        "Abstract": "A 90-kDa surface glycoprotein was previously isolated and shown to be required for infection by the \"major\" group of human rhinovirus (HRV) serotypes. In the present work, the amino acid sequence of the receptor protein was obtained from CNBr and tryptic peptides. Using degenerate oligonucleotides predicted from the peptide sequences, we identified four cDNA clones that encode a 3-kilobase mRNA. The clones were ligated, subcloned in a simian virus 40 expression vector, and used to transfect receptor-negative Vero (monkey) cells. Results showed that transfected cells expressed receptor molecules capable of binding HRV and a monoclonal antibody which recognizes the major group HRV receptor. The cloned receptor cDNA encoded a protein with a sequence nearly identical to that of the intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), indicating that the two surface proteins are one and the same. Both proteins have identical mass, carbohydrate composition, and tissue distribution. In addition, major group receptors on HeLa cells could be induced with various cytokines in a manner similar to the ICAM-1 ligand. A similar induction of the HRV \"minor\" group receptor was not observed.",
