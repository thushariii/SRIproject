        "Abstract": "Macrophages are tissue resident innate phagocytic cells that take on contrasting phenotypes, or polarization states, in response to the changing combination of microbial and cytokine signals at sites of infection. During the opening stages of an infection, macrophages adopt the proinflammatory, highly antimicrobial M1 state, later shifting to an anti-inflammatory, pro-tissue repair M2 state as the infection resolves. The changes in gene expression underlying these transitions are primarily governed by nuclear factor kappaB (NF-κB), Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activation of transcription (STAT), and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1) transcription factors, the activity of which must be carefully controlled to ensure an effective yet spatially and temporally restricted inflammatory response. While much of this control is provided by pathway-specific feedback loops, recent work has shown that the transcriptional co-regulators of the CBP/p300-interacting transactivator with glutamic acid/aspartic acid-rich carboxy-terminal domain (CITED) family serve as common controllers for these pathways. In this review, we describe how CITED proteins regulate polarization-associated gene expression changes by controlling the ability of transcription factors to form chromatin complexes with the histone acetyltransferase, CBP/p300. We will also cover how differences in the interactions between CITED1 and 2 with CBP/p300 drive their contrasting effects on pro-inflammatory gene expression.",

        "Abstract": "Cytochrome c oxidase is the terminal enzyme of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, without which oxidative metabolism cannot be carried to completion. It is one of only four unique, bigenomic proteins in mammalian cells. The holoenzyme is made up of three mitochondrial-encoded and ten nuclear-encoded subunits in a 1:1 stoichiometry. The ten nuclear subunit genes are located in nine different chromosomes. The coordinated regulation of such a multisubunit, multichromosomal, bigenomic enzyme poses a challenge. It is especially so for neurons, whose mitochondria are widely distributed in extensive dendritic and axonal processes, resulting in the separation of the mitochondrial from the nuclear genome by great distances. Neuronal activity dictates COX activity that reflects protein amount, which, in turn, is regulated at the transcriptional level. All 13 COX transcripts are up- and downregulated by neuronal activity. The ten nuclear COX transcripts and those for Tfam and Tfbms important for mitochondrial COX transcripts are transcribed in the same transcription factory. Bigenomic regulation of all 13 transcripts is mediated by nuclear respiratory factors 1 and 2 (NRF-1 and NRF-2). NRF-1, in addition, also regulates critical neurochemicals of glutamatergic synaptic transmission, thereby ensuring the tight coupling of energy metabolism and neuronal activity at the molecular level in neurons.",

        "Abstract": "Depression is a serious neuropsychiatric disease affecting an increasing number of people worldwide. Cognitive deficits (including inattention, poor memory, and decision-making difficulties) are common in the clinical picture of depression. Cognitive impairment has been hypothesized to be one of the most important components of major depressive disorder (MDD; referred to as clinical depression), although typical cognitive symptoms are less frequent in people with depression than in people with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder (BD; sometimes referred to as manic-depressive disorder). The importance of α-Klotho in the aging process has been well-documented. Growing evidence points to the role of α-Klotho in regulating other biological functions, including responses to oxidative stress and the modulation of synaptic plasticity. It has been proven that a Klotho deficit may contribute to the development of various nervous system pathologies, such as behavioral disorders or neurodegeneration. Given the growing evidence of the role of α-Klotho in depression and cognitive impairment, it is assumed that this protein may be a molecular link between them. Here, we provide a research review of the role of α-Klotho in depression and cognitive impairment. Furthermore, we propose potential mechanisms (related to oxidative stress and glutamatergic transmission) that may be important in α-Klotho-mediated regulation of mental and cognitive function.",

        "Abstract": "The extracellular accumulation of glutamate is a pathologic hallmark of numerous neurodegenerative diseases including ischemic stroke and Alzheimer's disease. At high extracellular concentrations, glutamate causes neuronal damage by promoting oxidative stress, which can lead to cellular death. This has led to significant interest in developing pharmacologic approaches to mitigate the oxidative toxicity caused by high levels of glutamate. Here, we show that the small molecule proteostasis regulator AA147 protects against glutamate-induced cell death in a neuronal-derived cell culture model. While originally developed as an activator of the activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) arm of the unfolded protein response, this AA147-dependent protection against glutamate toxicity is primarily mediated through activation of the NRF2-regulated oxidative stress response. We demonstrate that AA147 activates NRF2 selectively in neuronal-derived cells through a mechanism involving metabolic activation to a reactive electrophile and covalent modification of KEAP1─a mechanism analogous to that involved in the AA147-dependent activation of ATF6. These results define the potential for AA147 to protect against glutamate-induced oxidative toxicity and highlight the potential for metabolically activated proteostasis regulators like AA147 to activate both protective ATF6 and NRF2 stress-responsive signaling pathways to mitigate oxidative damage associated with diverse neurologic diseases.",
