In this study, we used alginate (Alg) and hyaluronic acid (HA) composite (80:20) beads for the sustained release of epidermal growth factor (EGF) delivery. Heparin crosslinked AlgHA beads showed significant loading and entrapment of EGF. Encapsulated beads demonstrated biocompatibility with rat L929 cells and significant migration at the concentration of AlgHAEGF100 and AlgHAEGF150 within 24 h. Both groups significantly improved the expression of Fetal Liver Kinase 1 (FLK-1) along with the Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1 (ICAM-1) protein in rat bone Mesenchymal stem cells (rbMSCs). In vivo assessment exhibited significant epithelialization and wound closure gaps within 2 weeks. Immunohistochemistry shows markedly significant levels of ICAM-1, FLK-1, and fibronectin (FN) in the AlgHAEGF100 and AlgHAEGF150 groups. Hence, we conclude that the EGF-loaded alginate-hyaluronic acid (AlgHA) bead system can be used to promote wound healing.",

        "Abstract": "VEGF-A is a key cytokine in tumor angiogenesis and a major therapeutic target for cancer. VEGF165 is the predominant isoform of VEGF-A, and it is the most potent angiogenesis stimulant. VEGFR2/KDR domains 2 and 3 (D2D3) bind to the N-terminal domain (NTD, residues 1-110) of VEGF165. Since removal of the heparin-binding domain (HBD, residues 111-165) markedly reduced the mitogenic activity of the growth factor, it has been proposed that the HBD plays a critical role in the mitogenicity of VEGF165. Here, we report that αvβ3 specifically bound to the isolated VEGF165 HBD but not to VEGF165 NTD. Based on docking simulation and mutagenesis, we identified several critical amino acid residues within the VEGF165 HBD required for αvβ3 binding, i.e., Arg123, Arg124, Lys125, Lys140, Arg145, and Arg149. We discovered that VEGF165 HBD binds to the KDR domain 1 (D1) and identified that Arg123 and Arg124 are critical for KDR D1 binding by mutagenesis, indicating that the KDR D1-binding and αvβ3-binding sites overlap in the HBD. Full-length VEGF165 mutant (R123A/R124A/K125A/K140A/R145A/R149A) defective in αvβ3 and KDR D1 binding failed to induce ERK1/2 phosphorylation, integrin β3 phosphorylation, and KDR phosphorylation and did not support proliferation of endothelial cells, although the mutation did not affect the KDR D2D3 interaction with VEGF165. Since β3-knockout mice are known to show enhanced VEGF165 signaling, we propose that the binding of KDR D1 to the VEGF165 HBD and KDR D2D3 binding to the VEGF165 NTD are critically involved in the potent mitogenicity of VEGF165. We propose that binding competition between KDR and αvβ3 to the VEGF165 HBD endows integrin αvβ3 with regulatory properties to act as a negative regulator of VEGF165 signaling.",

        "Abstract": "VEGF-A is a key cytokine in tumor angiogenesis and a major therapeutic target for cancer. VEGF165 is the predominant isoform of VEGF-A, and it is the most potent angiogenesis stimulant. VEGFR2/KDR domains 2 and 3 (D2D3) bind to the N-terminal domain (NTD, residues 1-110) of VEGF165. Since removal of the heparin-binding domain (HBD, residues 111-165) markedly reduced the mitogenic activity of the growth factor, it has been proposed that the HBD plays a critical role in the mitogenicity of VEGF165. Here, we report that αvβ3 specifically bound to the isolated VEGF165 HBD but not to VEGF165 NTD. Based on docking simulation and mutagenesis, we identified several critical amino acid residues within the VEGF165 HBD required for αvβ3 binding, i.e., Arg123, Arg124, Lys125, Lys140, Arg145, and Arg149. We discovered that VEGF165 HBD binds to the KDR domain 1 (D1) and identified that Arg123 and Arg124 are critical for KDR D1 binding by mutagenesis, indicating that the KDR D1-binding and αvβ3-binding sites overlap in the HBD. Full-length VEGF165 mutant (R123A/R124A/K125A/K140A/R145A/R149A) defective in αvβ3 and KDR D1 binding failed to induce ERK1/2 phosphorylation, integrin β3 phosphorylation, and KDR phosphorylation and did not support proliferation of endothelial cells, although the mutation did not affect the KDR D2D3 interaction with VEGF165. Since β3-knockout mice are known to show enhanced VEGF165 signaling, we propose that the binding of KDR D1 to the VEGF165 HBD and KDR D2D3 binding to the VEGF165 NTD are critically involved in the potent mitogenicity of VEGF165. We propose that binding competition between KDR and αvβ3 to the VEGF165 HBD endows integrin αvβ3 with regulatory properties to act as a negative regulator of VEGF165 signaling.",

In this study, we used alginate (Alg) and hyaluronic acid (HA) composite (80:20) beads for the sustained release of epidermal growth factor (EGF) delivery. Heparin crosslinked AlgHA beads showed significant loading and entrapment of EGF. Encapsulated beads demonstrated biocompatibility with rat L929 cells and significant migration at the concentration of AlgHAEGF100 and AlgHAEGF150 within 24 h. Both groups significantly improved the expression of Fetal Liver Kinase 1 (FLK-1) along with the Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1 (ICAM-1) protein in rat bone Mesenchymal stem cells (rbMSCs). In vivo assessment exhibited significant epithelialization and wound closure gaps within 2 weeks. Immunohistochemistry shows markedly significant levels of ICAM-1, FLK-1, and fibronectin (FN) in the AlgHAEGF100 and AlgHAEGF150 groups.
