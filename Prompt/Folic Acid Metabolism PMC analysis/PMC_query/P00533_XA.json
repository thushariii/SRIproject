        "Abstract": "A series of 2-amino-4-m-bromoanilino-6-benzyl pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidines analogues 4-12 were synthesized and evaluated as inhibitors of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). These analogues were synthesized from the appropriate alpha-bromomethylbenzylketones via cyclocondensation with 2,6-diamino-4-pyrimidone to afford the 2-amino-4-oxo-6-substituted benzyl pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidines. Chlorination at the 4-position followed by displacement with 3-bromoaniline or 3-bromo-N-methylaniline and methylation of the 7-NH afforded the target compounds. Remarkably, dimethylation of both the 4-N and N7 afford whole cell EGFR inhibitors that are more cytotoxic than clinically used erlotinib and mono-methylation at the 4-N or N7 affords more cytotoxic whole cell PDGFR-beta inhibitors than clinically used sunitinib. Methylation at either the 4-N or N7 position was detrimental to whole cell VEGFR-2 inhibition. The inhibitory data against the RTKs in this study demonstrates that methylation of the 4-NH and/or the 7-NH influences both the specificity and potency of RTK inhibition.",

        "Abstract": "Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene alterations have been found in human lung cancers. However, there is no information on the factors inducing EGFR mutations. In rodents, K-ras mutations are frequently found in many lung carcinogenesis models, but hitherto, Egfr mutations have not been reported. Their presence was therefore investigated in representative lung carcinogenesis models with 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK), N-nitrosobis(2-hydroxypropyl)amine (BHP), 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx) and ethyl carbamate (urethane), as well as X-ray irradiation. With the chemical carcinogenesis models, no mutations were detected in Egfr, which is in clear contrast to the high rates observed in either codon 12 or 61 of K-ras (21/23 of the lung tumors induced with NNK, 4/5 with MeIQx, 1/4 with urethane and 7/18 with BHP). However, in the X-ray-induced lung tumors, Egfr mutations with amino acid substitution were observed in exons 18 and 21 (4/12, 33%), but no activating mutation of K-ras was detected. In addition, one and four silent mutations were identified in K-ras (exon 1) and Egfr (exons 18, 20 and 21), respectively. Most mutations in both Egfr and K-ras were G/C-->A/T transitions (7/8, 88% and 31/34, 91%, respectively). Although, the mutational patterns in equivalent human lesions were not completely coincident, this first report of Egfr mutations in an experimental lung tumor model suggests that X-rays or other factors producing oxygen radicals could cause EGFR mutations in some proportion of lung cancers in humans.",

        "Abstract": "Mouse capillary endothelial cells (1G11 cell line) embedded in type I collagen gels undergo in vitro angiogenesis. Cells rapidly reorganize and form capillary-like structures when stimulated with serum. Transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) alone can substitute for serum and induce cell survival and tubular network formation. This TGF-beta1-mediated angiogenic activity depends on phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. We showed that specific inhibitors of either pathway (wortmannin, LY-294002, and PD-98059) all suppressed TGF-beta1-induced angiogenesis mainly by compromising cell survival. We established that TGF-beta1 stimulated the expression of TGF-alpha mRNA and protein, the tyrosine phosphorylation of a 170-kDa membrane protein representing the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor, and the delayed activation of PI3K/Akt and p42/p44 MAPK. Moreover, we showed that all these TGF-beta1-mediated signaling events, including tubular network formation, were suppressed by incubating TGF-beta1-stimulated endothelial cells with a soluble form of an EGF receptor (ErbB-1) or tyrphostin AG1478, a specific blocker of EGF receptor tyrosine kinase. Finally, addition of TGF-alpha alone poorly stimulated angiogenesis; however, by reducing cell death, it strongly potentiated the action of TGF-beta1. We therefore propose that TGF-beta1 promotes angiogenesis at least in part via the autocrine secretion of TGF-alpha, a cell survival growth factor, activating PI3K/Akt and p42/p44 MAPK.",
