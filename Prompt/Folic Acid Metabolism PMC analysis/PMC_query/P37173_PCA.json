        "Abstract": "At present, TGF-β is the most critical fibrogenic factor known. Smad ubiquitin ligase Smurfs play an important role in the regulation of the TGF-/Smads signaling pathway, which is linked to metabolite changes in renal fibrosis. Previous studies have shown that Shenkang injection can prevent and treat chronic kidney disease through multiple channels of action. However, the precise relationship between Shenkang injection and the regulation of the TGF-/Smads signaling pathway in the treatment of chronic kidney disease is unknown. Here, we evaluated the pharmacological effects of Shenkang injection on ubiquitination and metabolic changes of the TGF-β/Smads signaling pathway in UUO mice using pathology-related indicators, immunoprecipitation, subcellular co-location, and metabonomics analysis. Our findings indicate that Shenkang injection can promote nuclear translocation of Smurf1 and Smurf2 to TGF- membrane receptors TR-I and Smad2 and ubiquitinated degradation of these proteins. Furthermore, the formation of TβR-I/TβR-II, TβR-I/Smad2, and TβR-I/Smad3 complexes was inhibited to negatively regulate the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway induced renal tubular epithelial transdifferentiation (EMT). The EMT process is not very relevant",

The mechanisms by which TβR-V mediates growth inhibition (tumor suppressor) signaling remain elusive. Previous studies revealed that IGFBP-3 and TGF-β inhibit growth in epithelial cells by stimulating TβR-V-mediated IRS-1/2-dependent activation and cytoplasm-to-nucleus translocation of IGFBP-3- or TGF-β-stimulated protein phosphatase (PPase), resulting in dephosphorylation of pRb-related proteins (p107, p130) or pRb, and growth arrest. To define the signaling, we characterized/identified the IGFBP-3- and TGF-β-stimulated PPases in cell lysates and nucleus fractions in Mv1Lu cells treated with IGFBP-3 and TGF-β, using a cell-free assay with",

        "Abstract": "Glaucoma filtration surgery (GFS) is an effective clinical treatment for glaucoma when intraocular pressure (IOP) control is poor. However, the occurrence of conjunctival scarring at the surgical site is the main reason for failure of the surgery. In a previous study, we isolated and developed S58, a novel nucleic acid aptamer targeting TβR II, by systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX). Here, we show how S58 sterically inhibits the TβR II interaction with TGF-β. The effects of topical S58 treatment were studied in a rabbit model of GFS. At 6 postoperative weeks, S58 reduced fibrosis and prolonged bleb survival in rabbits after GFS. Further in vitro tests showed that the levels of fibrosis in S58 treated-Human Conjunctival Fibroblasts (HConFs) were decreased and that antioxidant defense was increased. In addition, the loss of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) or the inhibition of phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt) reversed the anti-fibrotic effects of S58. The present work suggests that S58 could effectively improve GFS surgical outcomes by activating the intracellular antioxidant defense PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 signaling pathway.",
