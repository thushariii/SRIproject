        "Abstract": "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a significant global health issue with diverse molecular profiles affecting treatment responses. Yet, NSCLC's molecular epidemiology in Morocco is largely unexplored. This study focuses on NSCLC genetic mutations, specifically in adenocarcinoma, among Moroccan patients to contribute to understanding NSCLC in this population. Ninety-four patients diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma were analyzed. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples were processed, and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)/ribonucleic acid (RNA) was extracted using standardized protocols. Mutations were detected using the AmoyDx Pan Lung Cancer Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) Panel kit, and their frequencies were assessed through statistical analysis. Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) mutations were detected in 22.34% of patients, predominantly exon 19 deletions (66.66%) and exon 21 L858R mutations (23.80%). Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene fusion was observed in 3.19% of patients, and KRAS mutations in 1.06%. No mutations were found in other tested genes. A slightly higher mutation rate was noted in females (54.16%) compared to males (45.84%). The study reveals a distinct mutation profile in Moroccan NSCLC patients, with a notable prevalence of EGFR mutations, albeit lower than in some Asian populations. The significance of EGFR mutations in treatment response aligns with global findings, highlighting the importance of understanding regional molecular variations for personalized therapy. Despite limitations in sample size and clinical data, this study sheds light on the genetic landscape of NSCLC in Morocco. The observed mutation rates, particularly in EGFR, underscore the potential for targeted therapies in Moroccan NSCLC patients, emphasizing the need for further research to refine treatment strategies tailored to this population.",

        "Abstract": "The main goal of the present study was to examine if the RNA-sequencing (RNAseq)-based ERBB2/HER2 expression level in malignant plasma cells from multiple myeloma (MM) patients has clinical significance for treatment outcomes and survival. We examined the relationship between the RNAseq-based ERBB2 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) levels in malignant plasma cells and survival outcomes in 787 MM patients treated on contemporary standard regimens. ERBB2 was expressed at significantly higher levels than ERBB1 as well as ERBB3 across all three stages of the disease. Upregulated expression of ERBB2 mRNA in MM cells was correlated with amplified expression of mRNAs for transcription factors (TF) that recognize the ERBB2 gene promoter sites. Patients with higher levels of ERBB2 mRNA in their malignant plasma cells experienced significantly increased cancer mortality, shorter progression-free survival, and worse overall survival than other patients. The adverse impact of high ERBB2 expression on patient survival outcomes remained significant in multivariate Cox proportional hazards models that accounted for the effects of other prognostic factors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of an adverse prognostic impact of high-level ERBB2 expression in MM patients. Our results encourage further evaluation of the prognostic significance of high-level ERBB2 mRNA expression and the clinical potential of ERBB2-targeting therapeutics as personalized medicines to overcome cancer drug resistance in high-risk as well as relapsed/refractory MM.",

        "Abstract": "The prolactin receptor (PRLR) is a member of the lactogen/cytokine receptor family, which mediates multiple actions of prolactin (PRL). PRL is a major hormone in the proliferation/differentiation of breast epithelium that is essential for lactation. It is also involved in breast cancer development, tumor growth and chemoresistance. Human PRLR expression is controlled at the transcriptional level by multiple promoters. Each promoter directs transcription/expression of a specific non-coding exon 1, a common non-coding exon 2 and coding exons E3-11. The identification of exon 11 of PRLR led to finding of alternative spliced products and two novel short forms (SF) that can inhibit the long form (LF) of PRLR activity with relevance in physiological regulation and breast cancer. Homo and heterodimers of LF and SF are formed in the absence of PRL that acts as a conformational modifier. Heterodimerization of SF with LF is a major mechanism through which SF inhibits some signaling pathways originating at the LF. Biochemical/molecular modeling approaches demonstrated that the human PRLR conformation stabilized by extracellular intramolecular S-S bonds and several amino acids in the extracellular D1 domain of PRLR SF are required for its inhibitory actions on PRLR LF-mediated functions. Studies in breast cancer cells demonstrated that the transcription of PRLR was directed by the preferentially utilized PIII promoter, which lacks an estrogen responsive element. Complex formation of non-DNA bound ERα dimer with Sp1 and C/EBPβ dimers bound to their sites at the PRLR promoter is required for basal activity. Estradiol induces transcriptional activation/expression of the PRLR gene, and subsequent studies revealed the essential role of autocrine PRL released by breast cancer cells and CDK7 in estradiol-induced PRLR promoter activation and upregulation. Other studies revealed stimulation of the PRLR promoter activity and PRLR LF protein by PRL in the absence of estrogen",

        "Abstract": "The nonstructural protein 1 (Nsp1) of SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2) is a virulence factor that targets multiple cellular pathways to inhibit host gene expression and antiviral response. However, the underlying mechanisms of the various Nsp1-mediated functions and their contributions to SARS-CoV-2 virulence remain unclear. Among the targets of Nsp1 is the mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid) export receptor NXF1-NXT1, which mediates nuclear export of mRNAs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Based on Nsp1 crystal structure, we generated mutants on Nsp1 surfaces and identified an acidic N-terminal patch that is critical for interaction with NXF1-NXT1. Photoactivatable Nsp1 probe reveals the RNA Recognition Motif (RRM) domain of NXF1 as an Nsp1 N-terminal binding site. By mutating the Nsp1 N-terminal acidic patch, we identified a separation-of-function mutant of Nsp1 that retains its translation inhibitory function but substantially loses its interaction with NXF1 and reverts Nsp1-mediated mRNA export inhibition. We then generated a recombinant (r)SARS-CoV-2 mutant on the Nsp1 N-terminal acidic patch and found that this surface is key to promote NXF1 binding and inhibition of host mRNA nuclear export, viral replication, and pathogenicity in vivo. Thus, these findings provide a mechanistic understanding of Nsp1-mediated mRNA export inhibition and establish the importance of this pathway in the virulence of SARS-CoV-2.",
