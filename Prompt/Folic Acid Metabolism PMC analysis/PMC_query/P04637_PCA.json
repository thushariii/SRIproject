        "Abstract": "In recent years, a cancer research trend has shifted towards identifying novel therapeutic compounds from natural assets for the management of cancer. In this study, we aimed to assess the cytotoxic activity of Kigelia Africana (KA) extracts on breast cancer (MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7) and noncancerous kidney cells (HEK-293T) to develop an efficient anticancer medication. We used gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS to analyze the constituents of EKA and HKA extracts meanwhile the crystal violet and the MTT (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-Diphenyltetrazolium Bromide) assays were used to examine the possible cytotoxic effects of plant extracts on our cancer cell lines along with non-cancerous control. The quantitative real-time PCR (RT-PCR) was run on cell samples to evaluate the differential expression of cell proliferative markers of cancer (BCL-2 and TP53). These phytochemicals have been reported to have binding affinity for some other growth factors and receptors as well which was evaluated by the in-silico molecular docking against Bcl2, EGFR, HER2, and TP53. Our Morphological observation showed a significant difference in the cell morphology and proliferation potential which was decreased under the effect of plant extracts treatment as compared to the control samples. The ethanol extract exhibited a marked antiproliferative activity towards MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cell lines with IC50 = 20 and 32 μg/mL, respectively. Quantitative RT-PCR gene expression investigation revealed that the IC50 concentration of ethanolic extract regulated the levels of mRNA expression of apoptotic genes. With the target and active binding site amino acids discovered in the molecular docking investigation, TP53/Propanoic acid, 3-(2, 3, 6-trimethyl-1, 4-dioxaspiro [4.4] non-7-yl)-, methyl ester (-7.1 kcal/mol) is the best-docked ligand. The use of this plant in folk remedies justifies its high in vitro anti-cancer capabilities. This work highlights the role of phytochemicals in the inhibition of cancer proliferation. Based on all these findings, it can be concluded that EKA extract has promising anti-proliferative effect on cancerous cells but more study is required in future to further narrow down the active ingredients of total crude extract with specific targets in cancer cells.",

        "Abstract": "Heterocyclic aromatic amines (HAAs), which are formed from the reaction of creatine or creatinine, amino acids, and sugars in meat and fish cooked at high temperatures, have been shown to be mutagenic in bacterial assays and carcinogenic in animal models. Following advances in the dietary assessment of HAA intake in epidemiological studies - including development of a validated meat-cooking module and a specialized food composition database - a number of epidemiological studies have specifically examined the association of HAA intake and cancer risk, most of which were conducted in Western countries. Given that dietary habits and cooking methods differ across countries, however, epidemiological investigation of dietary HAA intake requires a population-specific assessment method. Here, we developed a practical method for assessing dietary HAA intake among Japanese using a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and evaluated its validity for use in epidemiological studies by comparison with 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo [4,5-b] pyridine (PhIP) levels in human hair. The Japan Public Health Center-based Prospective Study reported that daily intake of HAAs among Japanese was relatively low, and that more than 50% of total intake in mainland Japan was derived from fish. Only four case-control studies in Japan have been reported so far, for colorectal, stomach and prostate cancer, and colorectal adenoma. A statistically significant positive association was found between 2-amino-3,4-dimethylimidazo [4,5-f] quinoline (MeIQ) and the risk of colorectal adenoma and between individual and total HAAs and the risk of prostate cancer. In contrast, no association was observed for colorectal or stomach cancer, or for colorectal adenoma among men. We also found that the limited and inconsistent findings among epidemiological studies are due to the difficulty in assessing exposure levels of HAAs. In addition to further evidence from prospective cohort studies in Japanese based on dietary HAA intake estimated by FFQs, studies using other methods to assess HAA exposure, such as biomarkers, are highly anticipated.",

        "Abstract": "The target and mechanism of ellagic acid (EA) against rotavirus (RV) were investigated by network pharmacology, computational biology, and surface plasmon resonance verification. The target of EA was obtained from 11 databases such as HIT and TCMSP, and RV-related targets were obtained from the Gene Cards database. The relevant targets were imported into the Venny platform to draw a Venn diagram, and their intersections were visualized. The protein-protein interaction networks (PPI) were constructed using STRING, DAVID database, and Cytoscape software, and key targets were screened. The target was enriched by Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway, and the 'EA anti-RV target-pathway network' was constructed. Schrodinger Maestro 13.5 software was used for molecular docking to determine the binding free energy and binding mode of ellagic acid and target protein. The Desmond program was used for molecular dynamics simulation. Saturation mutagenesis analysis was performed using Schrodinger's Maestro 13.5 software. Finally, the affinity between ellagic acid and TLR4 protein was investigated by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments. The results of network pharmacological analysis showed that there were 35 intersection proteins, among which Interleukin-1β (IL-1β), Albumin (ALB), Nuclear factor kappa-B1 (NF-κB1), Toll-Like Receptor 4 (TLR4), Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), Tumor protein p53 (TP53), Recombinant SMAD family member 3 (SAMD3), Epidermal growth factor (EGF) and Interleukin-4 (IL-4) were potential core targets of EA anti-RV. The GO analysis consists of biological processes (BP), cellular components (CC), and molecular functions (MF). The KEGG pathways with the highest gene count were mainly related to enteritis, cancer, IL-17 signaling pathway, and MAPK signaling pathway. Based on the crystal structure of key targets, the complex structure models of TP53-EA, TLR4-EA, TNF-EA, IL-1β-EA, ALB-EA, NF-κB1-EA, SAMD3-EA, EGF-EA, and IL-4-EA were constructed by molecular docking (XP mode of flexible docking). The MMGBS analysis and molecular dynamics simulation were also studied. The Δaffinity of TP53 was highest in 220 (CYS → TRP), 220 (CYS → TYR), and 220 (CYS → PHE), respectively. The Δaffinity of TLR4 was highest in 136 (THR → TYR), 136 (THR → PHE), and 136 (THR → TRP). The Δaffinity of TNF-α was highest in 150 (VAL → TRP), 18 (ALA → GLU), and 144 (PHE → GLY). SPR results showed that ellagic acid could bind TLR4 protein specifically. TP53, TLR4, and TNF-α are potential targets for EA to exert anti-RV effects, which may ultimately provide theoretical basis and clues for EA to be used as anti-RV drugs by regulating TLR4/NF-κB related pathways.",

Based on the crystal structure of key targets, the complex structure models of TP53-EA, TLR4-EA, TNF-EA, IL-1β-EA, ALB-EA, NF-κB1-EA, SAMD3-EA, EGF-EA, and IL-4-EA were constructed by molecular docking (XP mode of flexible docking). The MMGBS analysis and molecular dynamics simulation were also studied. The Δaffinity of TP53 was highest in 220 (CYS → TRP), 220 (CYS → TYR), and 220 (CYS → PHE), respectively. The Δaffinity of TLR4 was highest in 136 (THR → TYR), 136 (THR → PHE), and 136 (THR → TRP). The Δaffinity of TNF-α was highest in 150 (VAL → TRP), 18 (ALA → GLU), and 144 (PHE → GLY). SPR results showed that ellagic acid could bind TLR4 protein specifically. TP53, TLR4, and TNF-α are potential targets for EA to exert anti-RV effects, which may ultimately provide theoretical basis and clues for EA to be used as anti-RV drugs by regulating TLR4/NF-κB related pathways.",

        "Abstract": "The target and mechanism of ellagic acid (EA) against rotavirus (RV) were investigated by network pharmacology, computational biology, and surface plasmon resonance verification. The target of EA was obtained from 11 databases such as HIT and TCMSP, and RV-related targets were obtained from the Gene Cards database. The relevant targets were imported into the Venny platform to draw a Venn diagram, and their intersections were visualized. The protein-protein interaction networks (PPI) were constructed using STRING, DAVID database, and Cytoscape software, and key targets were screened. The target was enriched by Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway, and the 'EA anti-RV target-pathway network' was constructed. Schrodinger Maestro 13.5 software was used for molecular docking to determine the binding free energy and binding mode of ellagic acid and target protein. The Desmond program was used for molecular dynamics simulation. Saturation mutagenesis analysis was performed using Schrodinger's Maestro 13.5 software. Finally, the affinity between ellagic acid and TLR4 protein was investigated by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments. The results of network pharmacological analysis showed that there were 35 intersection proteins, among which Interleukin-1β (IL-1β), Albumin (ALB), Nuclear factor kappa-B1 (NF-κB1), Toll-Like Receptor 4 (TLR4), Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), Tumor protein p53 (TP53), Recombinant SMAD family member 3 (SAMD3), Epidermal growth factor (EGF) and Interleukin-4 (IL-4) were potential core targets of EA anti-RV.

Several mechanisms responsible for in vitro cytotoxicity have been proposed. These include the penetration of nZnO into the cytoplasm, generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) that degrade mitochondrial function, induce endoplasmic reticulum stress, and damage deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), lipid, and protein molecules. Otherwise, nZnO dissolve extracellularly into zinc ions and the subsequent diffusion of ions into the cytoplasm can create ROS. Furthermore, internalization of nZnO and localization in acidic lysosomes result in their dissolution into zinc ions, producing ROS too in cytoplasm. These ROS-mediated responses induce caspase-dependent apoptosis via the activation of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2), Bcl2-associated X protein (Bax), CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (chop), and phosphoprotein p53 gene expressions.

        "Abstract": "It is well-established that, through canonical functions in transcription and DNA repair, the tumor suppressor p53 plays a central role in safeguarding cells from the consequences of DNA damage. Recent data retrieved in tumor and stem cells demonstrated that p53 also carries out non-canonical functions when interacting with the translesion synthesis (TLS) polymerase iota (POLι) at DNA replication forks. This protein complex triggers a DNA damage tolerance (DDT) mechanism controlling the DNA replication rate. Given that the levels of p53 trigger non-binary rheostat-like functions in response to stress or during differentiation, we explore the relevance of the p53 levels for its DDT functions at the fork. We show that subtle changes in p53 levels modulate the contribution of some DDT factors including POLι, POLη, POLζ, REV1, PCNA, PRIMPOL, HLTF and ZRANB3 to the DNA replication rate. Our results suggest that the levels of p53 are central to coordinate the balance between DDT pathways including (i) fork-deceleration by the ZRANB3-mediated fork reversal factor, (ii) POLι-p53-mediated fork-slowing, (iii) POLι- and POLη-mediated TLS and (iv) PRIMPOL-mediated fork-acceleration.

        "Abstract": "Choline deficiency causes disorders including hepatic abnormalities and is associated with an increased risk of multiple types of cancer. Here, by choline-free diet-associated RNA-Seq analyses, we found that the tumor suppressor p53 drives the Kennedy pathway via PCYT1B to control the growth of lipid droplets (LDs) and their fueling role in tumorigenesis. Mechanistically, through upregulation of PCYT1B, p53 channeled depleted choline stores to phosphatidylcholine (PC) biosynthesis during choline starvation, thus preventing LD coalescence. Cells lacking p53 failed to complete this response to choline depletion, leading to hepatic steatosis and tumorigenesis, and these effects could be reversed by enforcement of PCYT1B expression or restoration of PC abundance. Furthermore, loss of p53 or defects in the Kennedy pathway increased surface localization of hormone-sensitive lipase on LDs to release specific fatty acids that fueled tumor cells in vivo and in vitro. Thus, p53 loss leads to dysregulation of choline metabolism and LD growth and couples perturbed LD homeostasis to tumorigenesis.",
