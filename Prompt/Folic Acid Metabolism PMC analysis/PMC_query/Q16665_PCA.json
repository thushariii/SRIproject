        "Abstract": "Hypoxia occurs in cancer, prolonged exercise, and long-term ischemia with durations of several hours or more, and the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1) pathway response to these conditions differs from responses to transient hypoxia. We used computational modeling, validated by experiments, to gain a quantitative, temporal understanding of the mechanisms driving HIF1 response. To test the hypothesis that HIF1 alpha protein levels during chronic hypoxia are tightly regulated by a series of molecular feedbacks, we took into account protein synthesis and product inhibition, and analyzed HIF1 system changes in response to hypoxic exposures beyond 3 to 4 h. We show how three autocrine feedback loops together regulate HIF 1 alpha hydroxylation in different microenvironments. Results demonstrate that prolyl hydroxylase, succinate and HIF1 alpha feedback determine intracellular HIF1 alpha levels over the course of hours to days. The model provides quantitative insight critical for characterizing molecular mechanisms underlying a cell's response to long-term hypoxia.",

        "Abstract": "Stroke and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are prevalent age-related diseases; however, the relationship between these two diseases remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to investigate the ability of melatonin, a hormone produced by the pineal gland, to alleviate the effects of ischemic stroke leading to AD by observing the pathogenesis of AD hallmarks. We utilized SH-SY5Y cells under the conditions of oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) and oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/R) to establish ischemic stroke conditions. We detected that hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), an indicator of ischemic stroke, was highly upregulated at both the protein and mRNA levels under OGD conditions. Melatonin significantly downregulated both HIF-1α mRNA and protein expression under OGD/R conditions. We detected the upregulation of β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) mRNA and protein expression under both OGD and OGD/R conditions, while 10 µM of melatonin attenuated these effects and inhibited beta amyloid (Aβ) production. Furthermore, we demonstrated that OGD/R conditions were able to activate the BACE1 promoter, while melatonin inhibited this effect. The present results indicate that melatonin has a significant impact on preventing the aberrant development of ischemic stroke, which can lead to the development of AD, providing new insight into the prevention of AD and potential stroke treatments.",

Hypoxia is a major feature of solid tumors and contributes to tumor development with striking alterations in the gene expression profile. Here, we show that hypoxia induces ATX expression in a hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) 2α-dependent fashion in human colon cancer SW480 cells. HIF-2α is directly bound to specific hypoxia response elements (HREs) in the ATX promoter. Under hypoxic conditions, knockout or inhibition of ATX suppressed the migration of SW480 cells, which could be rescued by the addition of LPA, suggesting that the induction of ATX during hypoxia promotes cancer cell migration through the ATX-LPA axis. Further studies showed that ATX expression was induced by HIF-2α through recruiting p300/CBP, which led to crotonylation but not acetylation of histone H3 in the ATX promoter region during hypoxia. Moreover, elevation of cellular histone crotonylation levels could induce ATX expression under normoxic conditions. In conclusion, our findings reveal that ATX is induced in SW480 cells during hypoxia by histone crotonylation in a HIF-2α-dependent manner, while as a novel mechanism of ATX expression regulation, the upregulation of ATX expression by histone crotonylation is not confined to hypoxia.",
