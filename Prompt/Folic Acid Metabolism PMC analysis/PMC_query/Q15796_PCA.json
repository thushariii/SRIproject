        "Abstract": "Activation by transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta)/activin receptors leads to phosphorylation of Smad2 (Sma- and Mad-related protein 2) and Smad3, which function as transcription factors to regulate gene expression. Using the MH2 domain (Mad homologue domain of Smad proteins 2) of Smad3 in a yeast two-hybrid screening, we isolated a novel splice variant of CAATT-binding factor subunit C (CBF-C), designated CBF-Cb, that associated with Smad3. CBF-C is one of the subunits that form a heterotrimeric CBF complex capable of binding and activating the CAATT motif found in the promoters of many eukaryotic genes. CBF-Cb is 62 amino acids shorter than the wild-type CBF-C in the N-terminal region. In addition, CBF-Cb is expressed ubiquitously in various mouse tissues. By an immunoprecipitation assay, we detected an in vivo association of CBF-Cb with Smad2 and Smad3, independent of signalling by activated TGF-beta type I receptors. In transient transfection experiments, overexpression of CBF-Cb was able to repress the transactivating activity of Smad2 and Smad3, mediated either by direct binding to the Smad-responsive element or through their association with the Smad-interacting transcription factor FAST-2 (forkhead activin signal transducer-2). The Smad-mediated transcriptional response after TGF-beta receptor activation was also inhibited by overexpression of unspliced CBF-C. In addition, the repressive activity of CBF-Cb on Smad2- and Smad3-mediated transcriptional regulation was abrogated by co-expression of the general transcription activator p300. The association of CBF-Cb with Smad2 was competitively inhibited by overexpression of p300. These data indicate a novel mechanism for modulation of the transcriptional activity of Smad proteins, whereby the interaction of CBF-Cb, as well as canonical CBF-C, with the MH2 domain of Smads may prevent the association of Smads with transcriptional co-activators.",

        "Abstract": "The prevalence of obesity and chronic kidney disease (CKD) is increasing simultaneously and rapidly worldwide. Our previous study showed that folate deficiency increased lipid accumulation and leptin production of adipocytes. Whether folate plays a role in CKD, particularly obesity-related nephropathy remains unclear. To investigate the effects of folate deficiency on CKD in diet-induced obese mice, four groups of male C57BL/6 mice were fed either a normal-fat diet (NF) with folate (NF+f); NF without folate (NF-f); high-fat high-fructose diet (HFF) with folate (HFF+f); or HFF without folate (HFF-f) for 12 months during the study. The results showed that HFF increased not only body weight, fasting blood glucose, total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, and blood pressure, but also cytokines levels, such as interleukin (IL)-2, interferon (IFN)-γ, IL-17A/F, IL-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1. The indicators of kidney failure including urinary protein, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), renal type I and IV collagen deposits and leptin content, and serum creatinine were also increased by HFF. Folate-deficient diets further elevated serum TC, LDL-cholesterol, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, MCP-1, TGF-β1, and leptin, but decreased IL-10 level, and thus exacerbated renal fibrosis. To investigate the possible mechanisms of folate deficiency on renal injury, phosphorylation of pro-fibrosis signaling molecules, including signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)3 and small mothers against decapentaplegic (Smad)2/3, were assayed. Both HFF and folate deficiency significantly increased the phosphorylation of STAT3 and Smad2/3, suggesting synergistic effects of HFF-f on chronic renal inflammation and fibrosis. In conclusion, the results demonstrated that folate deficiency might aggravate inflammatory status and enhance renal fibrosis.",

        "Abstract": "Salivary gland tissue engineering offers an attractive alternative for the treatment of radiation-induced xerostomia. Key to the success of this approach is the maintenance and expansion of secretory acinar cells in vitro. However, recent studies revealed that in vitro culture of primary salivary gland epithelial cells led to undesirable upregulation of the expression of keratin-7 (K7), a marker of ductal phenotype and frequently associated with cellular stress. We have previously shown that hyaluronic acid (HA)-based, RGDSP-decorated hydrogels support the 3D growth and assembly of primary human salivary gland stem/progenitor cells (hS/PCs). Here, we investigate whether the RGDSP culture also promotes K7 expression, and if so, what factors govern the K7 expression. Compared to hS/PCs maintained in blank HA gels, those grown in RGDSP cultures expressed a significantly higher level of K7. In other tissues, various transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily members are reported to regulate K7 expression. Similarly, our immunoblot array and ELISA experiments confirmed the increased expression of TGF-β1 and growth/differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15) in RGDSP cultures. However, 2D model studies show that only TGF-β1 is required to induce K7 expression in hS/PCs. Immunocytochemical analysis of the intracellular effectors of TGF-β signaling, SMAD 2/3, further confirmed the elevated TGF-β signaling in RGDSP cultures. To maximize the regenerative potential of h/SPCs, cultures were treated with a pharmacological inhibitor of TGF-β receptor, A83-01. Our results show that A83-01 treatment can repress K7 expression not only in 3D RGDSP cultures but also under 2D conditions with exogenous TGF-β1. Collectively, we provide a link between TGF-β signaling and K7 expression in hS/PC cultures and demonstrate the effectiveness of TGF-β inhibition to repress K7 expression while maintaining the ability of RGDSP-conjugated HA gels to facilitate the rapid development of amylase expressing spheroids.

        "Abstract": "The prevalence of obesity and chronic kidney disease (CKD) is increasing simultaneously and rapidly worldwide. Our previous study showed that folate deficiency increased lipid accumulation and leptin production of adipocytes. Whether folate plays a role in CKD, particularly obesity-related nephropathy remains unclear. To investigate the effects of folate deficiency on CKD in diet-induced obese mice, four groups of male C57BL/6 mice were fed either a normal-fat diet (NF) with folate (NF+f); NF without folate (NF-f); high-fat high-fructose diet (HFF) with folate (HFF+f); or HFF without folate (HFF-f) for 12 months during the study. The results showed that HFF increased not only body weight, fasting blood glucose, total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, and blood pressure, but also cytokines levels, such as interleukin (IL)-2, interferon (IFN)-γ, IL-17A/F, IL-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1. The indicators of kidney failure including urinary protein, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), renal type I and IV collagen deposits and leptin content, and serum creatinine were also increased by HFF. Folate-deficient diets further elevated serum TC, LDL-cholesterol, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, MCP-1, TGF-β1, and leptin, but decreased IL-10 level, and thus exacerbated renal fibrosis. To investigate the possible mechanisms of folate deficiency on renal injury, phosphorylation of pro-fibrosis signaling molecules, including signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)3 and small mothers against decapentaplegic (Smad)2/3, were assayed. Both HFF and folate deficiency significantly increased the phosphorylation of STAT3 and Smad2/3, suggesting synergistic effects of HFF-f on chronic renal inflammation and fibrosis. In conclusion, the results demonstrated that folate deficiency might aggravate inflammatory status and enhance renal fibrosis.",

        "Abstract": "Changes in diet culture and modern lifestyle contributed to a higher incidence of gastrointestinal-related diseases, including gastritis, implicated in the pathogenesis of gastric cancer. This observation raised concerns regarding exposure to di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), which is linked to adverse health effects, including reproductive and developmental problems, inflammatory response, and invasive adenocarcinoma. Research on the direct link between DEHP and gastric cancer is ongoing, and further studies are required to establish a conclusive association. In our study, extremely low concentrations of DEHP exerted significant effects on cell migration by promoting the epithelial-mesenchymal transition in gastric cancer cells. This effect was mediated by the modulation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and Smad2 signaling pathways. To address the DEHP challenges, our initial design of TPGS-conjugated fucoidan, delivered via pH-responsive nanoparticles, successfully demonstrated binding to the P-selectin protein. This achievement has not only enhanced the antigastric tumor efficacy but has also led to a significant reduction in the expression of malignant proteins associated with the condition. These findings underscore the promising clinical therapeutic potential of our approach.",

        "Abstract": "Nuclear translocation of mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 2/3 (SMAD2/3), core transcription factors of transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signaling, is critical for hepatic stellate cell (HSC) differentiation into metastasis-promoting myofibroblasts. SMAD2/3 have multiple coactivators, including WW domain-containing transcription regulator protein 1 (WWTR1 or TAZ) and p300 acetyltransferase. In the nucleus, TAZ binds to SMAD2/3 to prevent SMAD2/3 nuclear export. However, how TAZ and SMAD2/3 enter the nucleus remains poorly understood because neither contains a nuclear localization signal (NLS), an amino acid sequence tagging proteins for nuclear transport. p300 is an NLS-containing large scaffold protein, so we hypothesized that SMAD2/3 and TAZ may undergo nuclear import through complexing with p300. Coimmunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence, and nuclear fractionation assays revealed that TGF-β1 promoted binding of SMAD2/3 and TAZ to p300 and that p300 inactivation disrupted TGF-β1-mediated SMAD2/3 and TAZ nuclear accumulation. Deleting the p300 NLS blocked TGF-β1-induced SMAD2/3 and TAZ nuclear transport. Consistently, p300 inactivation suppressed TGF-β1-mediated HSC activation and transcription of genes encoding tumor-promoting factors, such as connective tissue growth factor, Tenascin C, Periostin, platelet-derived growth factor C, and fibroblast growth factor 2, as revealed by microarray analysis. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-real-time quantitative PCR showed that canonical p300-mediated acetylation of histones also facilitated transcription in response to TGF-β1 stimulation. Interestingly, although both TGF-β1-mediated and stiffness-mediated HSC activation require p300, comparison of gene expression data sets revealed that transcriptional targets of TGF-β1 were distinct from those of stiffness-p300 mechanosignaling. Lastly, in tumor/HSC coinjection and intrasplenic tumor injection models, targeting p300 of activated-HSC/myofibroblasts by C646, short hairpin RNA, or cre-mediated gene disruption reduced tumor and liver metastatic growth in mice. Conclusion: p300 facilitates TGF-β1-stimulated HSC activation by both noncanonical (cytoplasm-to-nucleus shuttle for SMAD2/3 and TAZ) and canonical (histone acetylation) mechanisms. p300 is an attractive target for inhibiting HSC activation and the prometastatic liver microenvironment.",

        "Abstract": "Protective effect of Qishen Yiqi dropping pills on the myocardium of rats with chronic heart failure (CHF) was investigated. Sixty rats were divided into the sham operation (n=20), the model (n=20) and the Qishen Yiqi dropping pill treatment group (n=20) using the random table method. The treatment group received administration of Qishen Yiqi dropping pills. The model and the sham operation group were given the same amount of normal saline. Within 24 h after the last administration, the rats were sacrificed. The myocardia were used for reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, western blot analysis and histological examination. In the sham operation group, cardiomyocytes were stained evenly and arranged neatly and densely with clear structures. In the model group, the cell morphology was fuzzy, the myocytes were hypertrophied, the nuclear pyknosis was fragmented, the arrangement was disordered, the intercellular space was narrowed, and the cytoplasm was missing. The apoptosis rates of cardiomyocytes in the model and Qishen Yiqi dropping pill treatment group were significantly higher than that in the sham operation group (P<0.05). The myocardial infarction areas in the model group and the Qishen Yiqi dropping pill treatment group were larger than that in the sham operation group (P<0.05). The expression levels of transforming growth factor-β1, mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 2 (Smad2), Smad3, and caspase-3 messenger ribonucleic acids and proteins in the model group and the Qishen Yiqi dropping pill treatment group were higher than those in the sham operation group (P<0.05). Qishen Yiqi dropping pills have an obvious myocardial protective effect on CHF rats, which may enhance the degree of myocardial fibrosis by inhibiting the TGF-β1/Smads pathway and improve cardiomyocyte apoptosis by suppressing the caspase-3 signaling pathway, thus protecting the myocardium.",

        "Abstract": "Myostatin (MSTN) is not only a key negative regulator of skeletal muscle secretion, however is also an endocrine factor that is transmitted to bone. To investigate the effect and possible mechanism of weight-bearing treadmill running on bone with poorly controlled Type 1 diabetes, rats were randomly divided into three groups: Normal control (NC), diabetic mellitus (DM) and diabetic exercise training groups (DM-WTR). The DM-WTR rats were trained with weight-bearing running. The results demonstrated that the levels of serum insulin, body weight, bone mass, muscle mass, grip strength, and serum calcium in the DM-WTR rats were significantly increased, whereas the levels of blood glucose, alkaline phosphatase, and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase were markedly reduced in the DM-WTR rats compared with the DM rats. Weight-bearing running inhibited streptozocin (STZ)-induced MSTN mRNA and protein expression in the diabetic rats. The mRNA and protein expression levels of activin type IIB receptor and mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 2/3 and its phosphorylation in femur DM-WTR rats were reduced compared with DM rats. In addition, weight-bearing running enhanced the STZ-induced Wnt and β-catenin expression levels and reduced the STZ-induced glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3β expression in diabetic rats' femora. In conclusion, the results suggested that weight-bearing running could partially ameliorate STZ-induced femur atrophy via MSTN downregulation, and this may be associated with the inactivation of Activin A Receptor Type 2B/Smad2/3 signaling pathways and the activation of the Wnt/GSK3β/β-catenin signaling pathway. Further studies are needed to verify these conclusions.",

        "Abstract": "The myofibroblast has been implicated to be an important pathogenic cell in all fibrotic diseases, through synthesis of excess extracellular matrix. Lung fibroblast migration, proliferation and differentiation into a myofibroblast‑like cell type are regarded as important steps in the formation of lung fibrosis. In the present study, the effect of maresin 1 (MaR 1), a pro‑resolving lipid mediator, on transforming growth factor (TGF)‑β1‑stimulated lung fibroblasts was investigated, and the underlying molecular mechanisms were examined. The results of the present study demonstrated that MaR 1 inhibited TGF‑β1‑induced proliferative and migratory ability, assessed using MTT and scratch wound healing assays. The TGF‑β1‑induced expression of α‑smooth muscle actin (α‑SMA) and collagen type I, the hallmarks of myofibroblast differentiation, was decreased by MaR 1 at the mRNA and protein levels, determined using the reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis, respectively. Immunofluorescence demonstrated that MaR 1 downregulated the TGF‑β1‑induced expression of α‑SMA. In addition, phosphorylated mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 2/3 (Smad2/3) and extracellular signal‑related kinases (ERK) 1/2 were upregulated in TGF-β1-induced lung fibroblasts, and these effects were attenuated by MaR 1 administration. In conclusion, the results of the present study demonstrated that MaR 1 inhibited the TGF‑β1‑induced proliferation, migration and differentiation of human lung fibroblasts. These observed effects may be mediated in part by decreased phosphorylation of Smad2/3 and ERK1/2 signaling pathways. Therefore, MaR 1 may be a potential therapeutic approach to lung fibrotic diseases.",

        "Abstract": "Protective effect of Qishen Yiqi dropping pills on the myocardium of rats with chronic heart failure (CHF) was investigated. Sixty rats were divided into the sham operation (n=20), the model (n=20) and the Qishen Yiqi dropping pill treatment group (n=20) using the random table method. The treatment group received administration of Qishen Yiqi dropping pills. The model and the sham operation group were given the same amount of normal saline. Within 24 h after the last administration, the rats were sacrificed. The myocardia were used for reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, western blot analysis and histological examination. In the sham operation group, cardiomyocytes were stained evenly and arranged neatly and densely with clear structures. In the model group, the cell morphology was fuzzy, the myocytes were hypertrophied, the nuclear pyknosis was fragmented, the arrangement was disordered, the intercellular space was narrowed, and the cytoplasm was missing. The apoptosis rates of cardiomyocytes in the model and Qishen Yiqi dropping pill treatment group were significantly higher than that in the sham operation group (P<0.05). The myocardial infarction areas in the model group and the Qishen Yiqi dropping pill treatment group were larger than that in the sham operation group (P<0.05). The expression levels of transforming growth factor-β1, mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 2 (Smad2), Smad3, and caspase-3 messenger ribonucleic acids and proteins in the model group and the Qishen Yiqi dropping pill treatment group were higher than those in the sham operation group (P<0.05). Qishen Yiqi dropping pills have an obvious myocardial protective effect on CHF rats, which may enhance the degree of myocardial fibrosis by inhibiting the TGF-β1/Smads pathway and improve cardiomyocyte apoptosis by suppressing the caspase-3 signaling pathway, thus protecting the myocardium.",

        "Abstract": "Myostatin (MSTN) is not only a key negative regulator of skeletal muscle secretion, however is also an endocrine factor that is transmitted to bone. To investigate the effect and possible mechanism of weight-bearing treadmill running on bone with poorly controlled Type 1 diabetes, rats were randomly divided into three groups: Normal control (NC), diabetic mellitus (DM) and diabetic exercise training groups (DM-WTR). The DM-WTR rats were trained with weight-bearing running. The results demonstrated that the levels of serum insulin, body weight, bone mass, muscle mass, grip strength, and serum calcium in the DM-WTR rats were significantly increased, whereas the levels of blood glucose, alkaline phosphatase, and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase were markedly reduced in the DM-WTR rats compared with the DM rats. Weight-bearing running inhibited streptozocin (STZ)-induced MSTN mRNA and protein expression in the diabetic rats. The mRNA and protein expression levels of activin type IIB receptor and mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 2/3 and its phosphorylation in femur DM-WTR rats were reduced compared with DM rats. In addition, weight-bearing running enhanced the STZ-induced Wnt and β-catenin expression levels and reduced the STZ-induced glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3β expression in diabetic rats' femora. In conclusion, the results suggested that weight-bearing running could partially ameliorate STZ-induced femur atrophy via MSTN downregulation, and this may be associated with the inactivation of Activin A Receptor Type 2B/Smad2/3 signaling pathways and the activation of the Wnt/GSK3β/β-catenin signaling pathway. Further studies are needed to verify these conclusions.",

        "Abstract": "The myofibroblast has been implicated to be an important pathogenic cell in all fibrotic diseases, through synthesis of excess extracellular matrix. Lung fibroblast migration, proliferation and differentiation into a myofibroblast‑like cell type are regarded as important steps in the formation of lung fibrosis. In the present study, the effect of maresin 1 (MaR 1), a pro‑resolving lipid mediator, on transforming growth factor (TGF)‑β1‑stimulated lung fibroblasts was investigated, and the underlying molecular mechanisms were examined. The results of the present study demonstrated that MaR 1 inhibited TGF‑β1‑induced proliferative and migratory ability, assessed using MTT and scratch wound healing assays. The TGF‑β1‑induced expression of α‑smooth muscle actin (α‑SMA) and collagen type I, the hallmarks of myofibroblast differentiation, was decreased by MaR 1 at the mRNA and protein levels, determined using the reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis, respectively. Immunofluorescence demonstrated that MaR 1 downregulated the TGF‑β1‑induced expression of α‑SMA. In addition, phosphorylated mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 2/3 (Smad2/3) and extracellular signal‑related kinases (ERK) 1/2 were upregulated in TGF-β1-induced lung fibroblasts, and these effects were attenuated by MaR 1 administration. In conclusion, the results of the present study demonstrated that MaR 1 inhibited the TGF‑β1‑induced proliferation, migration and differentiation of human lung fibroblasts. These observed effects may be mediated in part by decreased phosphorylation of Smad2/3 and ERK1/2 signaling pathways. Therefore, MaR 1 may be a potential therapeutic approach to lung fibrotic diseases.",

        "Abstract": "Nuclear translocation of mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 2/3 (SMAD2/3), core transcription factors of transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signaling, is critical for hepatic stellate cell (HSC) differentiation into metastasis-promoting myofibroblasts. SMAD2/3 have multiple coactivators, including WW domain-containing transcription regulator protein 1 (WWTR1 or TAZ) and p300 acetyltransferase. In the nucleus, TAZ binds to SMAD2/3 to prevent SMAD2/3 nuclear export. However, how TAZ and SMAD2/3 enter the nucleus remains poorly understood because neither contains a nuclear localization signal (NLS), an amino acid sequence tagging proteins for nuclear transport. p300 is an NLS-containing large scaffold protein, so we hypothesized that SMAD2/3 and TAZ may undergo nuclear import through complexing with p300. Coimmunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence, and nuclear fractionation assays revealed that TGF-β1 promoted binding of SMAD2/3 and TAZ to p300 and that p300 inactivation disrupted TGF-β1-mediated SMAD2/3 and TAZ nuclear accumulation. Deleting the p300 NLS blocked TGF-β1-induced SMAD2/3 and TAZ nuclear transport. Consistently, p300 inactivation suppressed TGF-β1-mediated HSC activation and transcription of genes encoding tumor-promoting factors, such as connective tissue growth factor, Tenascin C, Periostin, platelet-derived growth factor C, and fibroblast growth factor 2, as revealed by microarray analysis. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-real-time quantitative PCR showed that canonical p300-mediated acetylation of histones also facilitated transcription in response to TGF-β1 stimulation. Interestingly, although both TGF-β1-mediated and stiffness-mediated HSC activation require p300, comparison of gene expression data sets revealed that transcriptional targets of TGF-β1 were distinct from those of stiffness-p300 mechanosignaling. Lastly, in tumor/HSC coinjection and intrasplenic tumor injection models, targeting p300 of activated-HSC/myofibroblasts by C646, short hairpin RNA, or cre-mediated gene disruption reduced tumor and liver metastatic growth in mice. Conclusion: p300 facilitates TGF-β1-stimulated HSC activation by both noncanonical (cytoplasm-to-nucleus shuttle for SMAD2/3 and TAZ) and canonical (histone acetylation) mechanisms. p300 is an attractive target for inhibiting HSC activation and the prometastatic liver microenvironment.",

        "Abstract": "The myofibroblast has been implicated to be an important pathogenic cell in all fibrotic diseases, through synthesis of excess extracellular matrix. Lung fibroblast migration, proliferation and differentiation into a myofibroblast‑like cell type are regarded as important steps in the formation of lung fibrosis. In the present study, the effect of maresin 1 (MaR 1), a pro‑resolving lipid mediator, on transforming growth factor (TGF)‑β1‑stimulated lung fibroblasts was investigated, and the underlying molecular mechanisms were examined. The results of the present study demonstrated that MaR 1 inhibited TGF‑β1‑induced proliferative and migratory ability, assessed using MTT and scratch wound healing assays. The TGF‑β1‑induced expression of α‑smooth muscle actin (α‑SMA) and collagen type I, the hallmarks of myofibroblast differentiation, was decreased by MaR 1 at the mRNA and protein levels, determined using the reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis, respectively. Immunofluorescence demonstrated that MaR 1 downregulated the TGF‑β1‑induced expression of α‑SMA. In addition, phosphorylated mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 2/3 (Smad2/3) and extracellular signal‑related kinases (ERK) 1/2 were upregulated in TGF-β1-induced lung fibroblasts, and these effects were attenuated by MaR 1 administration. In conclusion, the results of the present study demonstrated that MaR 1 inhibited the TGF‑β1‑induced proliferation, migration and differentiation of human lung fibroblasts. These observed effects may be mediated in part by decreased phosphorylation of Smad2/3 and ERK1/2 signaling pathways. Therefore, MaR 1 may be a potential therapeutic approach to lung fibrotic diseases.",
