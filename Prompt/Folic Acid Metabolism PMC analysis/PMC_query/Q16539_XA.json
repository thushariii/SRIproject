        "Abstract": "In order to explore the synergistic mechanisms of combinatorial treatment using curcumin and mitomycin C (MMC) for breast cancer, MCF-7 breast cancer xenografts were conducted to observe the synergistic effect of combinatorial treatment using curcumin and MMC at various dosages. The synergistic mechanisms of combinatorial treatment using curcumin and MMC on the inhibition of tumor growth were explored by differential gene expression profile, gene ontology (GO), ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) and Signal-Net network analysis. The expression levels of selected genes identified by cDNA microarray expression profiling were validated by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blot analysis. Effect of combinatorial treatment on the inhibition of cell growth was observed by MTT assay. Apoptosis was detected by flow cytometric analysis and Hoechst 33258 staining. The combinatorial treatment of 100 mg/kg curcumin and 1.5 mg/kg MMC revealed synergistic inhibition on tumor growth. Among 1501 differentially expressed genes, the expression of 25 genes exhibited an obvious change and a significant difference in 27 signal pathways was observed (p<0.05). In addition, Mapk1 (ERK) and Mapk14 (MAPK p38) had more cross-interactions with other genes and revealed an increase in expression by 8.14- and 11.84-fold, respectively during the combinatorial treatment by curcumin and MMC when compared with the control. Moreover, curcumin can synergistically improve tumoricidal effect of MMC in another human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells. Apoptosis was significantly induced by the combinatorial treatment (p<0.05) and significantly inhibited by ERK inhibitor (PD98059) in MCF-7 cells (p<0.05). The synergistic effect of combinatorial treatment by curcumin and MMC on the induction of apoptosis in breast cancer cells may be via the ERK pathway.",

In the present study, we have investigated the ability of several stress stimuli to activate SAPKs in platelets and to induce phosphorylation of their substrates. Treatment of human platelets with H(2)O(2) stimulated SAPK2a and its downstream target mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase-2 (MAPKAP-K2). Kinase activity reached a maximum after 2-5 min and declined towards basal levels after 15 min. Arsenite caused a steady increase of MAPKAP-K2 activity up to 15 min. The level of maximal kinase activation by H(2)O(2) and arsenite was comparable with the effect caused by the physiological platelet stimulus thrombin. A high osmolarity solution of sorbitol induced comparatively small activation of SAPK2a and MAPKAP-K2. The 42-kDa extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 2 was not activated by H(2)O(2), sorbitol or arsenite. None of these stimuli triggered significant arachidonic acid release on their own. However, H(2)O(2) and sorbitol enhanced the release of arachidonic acid induced by the calcium ionophore A23187. This effect was reversed by the inhibitor of SAPK2a, 4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-(4-methylsulphinylphenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl) imidazole (SB 203580), but not by the inhibitor of the ERK2-activating pathway, 2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-oxanaphthalen-4-one (PD 98059).

Drug discovery efforts have developed MAP kinase inhibitors directed toward the ATP binding site and neighboring \"DFG-out\" site, both of which are targets for inhibitors of other protein kinases. On the other hand, MAP kinases have unique substrate and small molecule binding sites that could serve as inhibition sites. The substrate and processing enzyme D-motif binding site is present in all MAP kinases, and has many features of a good small molecule binding site. Further, the MAP kinase p38alpha has a binding site near its C-terminus discovered in crystallographic studies. Finally, the MAP kinases ERK2 and p38alpha have a second substrate binding site, the FXFP binding site that is exposed in active ERK2 and the D-motif peptide induced conformation of MAP kinases. Crystallographic evidence of these latter two binding sites is presented.",

        "Abstract": "Tamoxifen (Tam), and its active metabolite, 4-hydroxytamoxifen (OHT), compete with estrogens for binding to the estrogen receptor (ER). Tam and OHT can also induce ER-dependent apoptosis of cancer cells. 10-100nM OHT induces ER-dependent apoptosis in approximately 3 days. Using HeLaER6 cells, we examined the role of OHT activation of signal transduction pathways in OHT-ER-mediated apoptosis. OHT-ER activated the p38, JNK and ERK1/2 pathways. Inhibition of p38 activation with SB203580, or RNAi-knockdown of p38alpha, moderately reduced OHT-ER mediated cell death. A JNK inhibitor partly reduced cell death. Surprisingly, the MEK1/2 inhibitor, PD98059, completely blocked OHT-ER induced apoptosis. EGF, an ERK1/2 activator, enhanced OHT-induced apoptosis. OHT induced a delayed and persistent phosphorylation of ERK1/2 that persisted for >80h. Addition of PD98059 as late as 24h after OHT largely blocked OHT-ER mediated apoptosis. The antagonist, ICI 182,780, blocked both the long-term OHT-mediated phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and OHT-induced apoptosis. Our data suggests that the p38 and JNK pathways, which often play a central role in apoptosis, have only a limited role in OHT-ER-mediated cell death. Although rapid activation of the ERK1/2 pathway is often associated with cell growth, persistent activation of the ERK1/2 pathway is essential for OHT-ER induced cell death.",

        "Abstract": "The uptake of 2-deoxyglucose into KB cells was stimulated about 2-fold by interleukin-1 (IL1), anisomycin or insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1). Stimulation by IL1 and anisomycin was prevented by SB 203580, a specific inhibitor of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase homologue termed 're-activating kinase' [RK; also known as p38, p40 and CSBP (cytokine synthesis anti-inflammatory-drug-binding protein)], but was unaffected by PD 98059, a specific inhibitor of the activation of the classical MAP kinase pathway. In contrast, the stimulation of 2-deoxyglucose uptake by IGF1 was blocked by PD 98059 and unaffected by SB 203580. Consistent with these observations, IL1 and anisomycin were potent activators of MAP kinase-activated protein (MAPKAP) kinase-2, a physiological substrate of RK, whereas IGF1 was only a very weak activator of MAPKAP kinase-2. Conversely, IGF1 was a stronger activator of p42 MAP kinase than IL1 or anisomycin. These results imply that the activation of distinct MAP kinase pathways is required for the stimulation of glucose transport by IL1/anisomycin and IGF1 in KB cells, and suggest that the combined use of SB 203580 and PD 98059 is a powerful new approach to explore the roles of different MAP kinase cascades in cell regulation.",
