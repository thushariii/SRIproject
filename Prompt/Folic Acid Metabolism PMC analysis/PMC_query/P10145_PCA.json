        "Abstract": "In a study of the structural basis for leukocyte specificity of chemoattractants, we determined the complete amino acid sequence of human glioma-derived monocyte chemotactic factor (GDCF-2), a peptide that attracts human monocytes but not neutrophils. The choice of a tumor cell product for analysis was dictated by its relative abundance and an amino acid composition indistinguishable from that of lymphocyte-derived chemotactic factor (LDCF), the agonist thought to account for monocyte accumulation in cellular immune reactions. By a combination of Edman degradation and mass spectrometry, it was established that GDCF-2 comprises 76 amino acid residues, commencing at the N terminus with pyroglutamic acid. The peptide contains four half-cystines, at positions 11, 12, 36, and 52, which create a pair of loops, clustered at the disulfide bridges. The relative positions of the half-cystines are almost identical to those of monocyte-derived neutrophil chemotactic factor (MDNCF), a peptide of similar mass but with only 24% sequence identity to GDCF. Thus, GDCF and MDNCF have a similar gross secondary structure because of the loops formed by the clustered disulfides, and their different leukocyte specificities are most likely determined by the large differences in primary sequence.",

        "Abstract": "Stimulated human monocytes release several proteins thought to play a role in inflammation, including interleukin 1, tumor necrosis factor, and plasminogen activator. We have purified another proinflammatory protein that is chemotactic for human neutrophils from conditioned medium of lipopolysaccharide-stimulated monocytes. After a series of steps that included anion-exchange chromatography, gel filtration, and HPLC on cation-exchange and reverse-phase columns, an apparently pure protein was obtained that migrated as a single 7-kDa band on NaDodSO4/polyacrylamide gels under reducing or nonreducing conditions. The amino acid composition of this monocyte-derived neutrophil chemotactic factor was different from that of interleukin 1 and tumor necrosis factor. N-terminal amino acid sequence of the first 42 residues was determined. This portion of the molecule has up to 56% sequence similarity with several proteins that may be involved in host responses to infection or tissue injury. It is identical to a portion of a sequence deduced from an mRNA induced by staphylococcal enterotoxin treatment of human leukocytes. At the optimal concentration of 10 nM, 50% of neutrophils added to chemotaxis assay wells migrated toward the pure attractant. Potency and efficacy are comparable to that of fMet-Leu-Phe, which is often used as a reference. In contrast to many attractants, the protein was not chemotactic for human monocytes.",

        "Abstract": "Pregnant women and their fetuses represent susceptible populations to environmental contaminants. Exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) among pregnant women may contribute to adverse birth outcomes such as preterm birth. Multiple previous studies have assessed airborne sources of PAHs among pregnant women but few have measured urinary PAH metabolites which can capture total exposure through multiple routes. The aim of this study was to bridge this knowledge gap by assessing longitudinal urinary PAH metabolite concentrations over two time points in pregnancy cohorts in Boston (N = 200) and Puerto Rico (N = 50) to better understand exposure distributions throughout pregnancy and how they relate to demographic factors. Urine samples were analyzed for 1-NAP, 2-NAP, 2-FLU, 1-PHE, 2,3-PHE, 4-PHE, 9-PHE, and 1-PYR. Concentrations of 2-NAP, 1-PYR, and 4-PHE were higher in Puerto Rico, while all other metabolites were present in higher concentrations in Boston. In Puerto Rico, intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were weak to moderate, ranging from 0.06 to 0.42. PAH metabolite concentrations were significantly higher among younger, heavier (except 1-NAP and 9-PHE), and less educated individuals in Boston only. Consistent significant associations between PAH concentrations and measured covariates were not found in Puerto Rico. Our results suggest that potentially important differences in PAH exposure exist between these two populations. Additionally, our results indicate that multiple urinary measurements are required to accurately assess PAH exposure throughout pregnancy.",

        "Abstract": "NAP-1 fold histone chaperones play an important role in escorting histones to and from sites of nucleosome assembly and disassembly. The two NAP-1 fold histone chaperones in budding yeast, Vps75 and Nap1, have previously been crystalized in a characteristic homodimeric conformation. In this study, a combination of small angle X-ray scattering, multi angle light scattering and pulsed electron-electron double resonance approaches were used to show that both Vps75 and Nap1 adopt ring-shaped tetrameric conformations in solution. This suggests that the formation of homotetramers is a common feature of NAP-1 fold histone chaperones. The tetramerisation of NAP-1 fold histone chaperones may act to shield acidic surfaces in the absence of histone cargo thus providing a 'self-chaperoning' type mechanism.",

        "Abstract": "Nucleosome assembly proteins (NAPs) are histone chaperones that are essential for the transfer and incorporation of histones into nucleosomes. NAPs participate in assembly and disassembly of nucleosomes and in chromatin structure organization. Human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum contains two nucleosome assembly proteins termed PfNapL and PfNapS. To gain structural insights into the mechanism of NAPs, we have determined and analyzed the crystal structure of PfNapL at 2.3 A resolution. PfNapL, an ortholog of eukaryotic NAPs, is dimeric in nature and adopts a characteristic fold seen previously for yeast NAP-1 and Vps75 and for human SET/TAF-1b (beta)/INHAT. The PfNapL monomer is comprised of domain I, containing a dimerization alpha-helix, and a domain II, composed of alpha-helices and a beta-subdomain. Structural comparisons reveal that the \"accessory domain,\" which is inserted between the domain I and domain II in yeast NAP-1 and other eukaryotic NAPs, is surprisingly absent in PfNapL. Expression of green fluorescent protein-tagged PfNapL confirmed its exclusive localization to the parasite cytoplasm. Attempts to disrupt the PfNapL gene were not successful, indicating its essential role for the malaria parasite. A detailed analysis of PfNapL structure suggests unique histone binding properties. The crucial structural differences observed between parasite and yeast NAPs shed light on possible new modes of histone recognition by nucleosome assembly proteins.",

        "Abstract": "Histone chaperones assemble and disassemble nucleosomes in an ATP-independent manner and thus regulate the most fundamental step in the alteration of chromatin structure. The molecular mechanisms underlying histone chaperone activity remain unclear. To gain insights into these mechanisms, we solved the crystal structure of the functional domain of SET/TAF-Ibeta/INHAT at a resolution of 2.3 A. We found that SET/TAF-Ibeta/INHAT formed a dimer that assumed a \"headphone\"-like structure. Each subunit of the SET/TAF-Ibeta/INHAT dimer consisted of an N terminus, a backbone helix, and an \"earmuff\" domain. It resembles the structure of the related protein NAP-1. Comparison of the crystal structures of SET/TAF-Ibeta/INHAT and NAP-1 revealed that the two proteins were folded similarly except for an inserted helix. However, their backbone helices were shaped differently, and the relative dispositions of the backbone helix and the earmuff domain between the two proteins differed by approximately 40 degrees . Our biochemical analyses of mutants revealed that the region of SET/TAF-Ibeta/INHAT that is engaged in histone chaperone activity is the bottom surface of the earmuff domain, because this surface bound both core histones and double-stranded DNA. This overlap or closeness of the activity surface and the binding surfaces suggests that the specific association among SET/TAF-Ibeta/INHAT, core histones, and double-stranded DNA is requisite for histone chaperone activity. These findings provide insights into the possible mechanisms by which histone chaperones assemble and disassemble nucleosome structures.",

The molecular mass was determined as approximately 10 kD by SDS-PAGE and isoelectric point was 10.7.

        "Abstract": "A factor able to induce an early local inflammation in rabbit skin was detected in the supernatant of mitogen-stimulated human blood leukocytes. The factor was different from IL-1 which, although present in the supernatants, was chemically separable from the factor and induced a late rather than an early skin response. Other biological effects of the principal factor were its in vitro chemotactic effects on granulocytes and its ability to induce rapid granulocytosis upon intravenous injection in rabbits. When tested under the same conditions, IL-1 beta did not act chemotactically and induced granulocytosis at a later time. The factor was purified to homogeneity and identified by electrophoretic mobility as a protein of Mr 6,500. Amino acid sequence analysis revealed the presence of an uncontaminated NH2-terminal sequence identical to a segment of the sequence previously predicted from the cDNA clone (3-10C) copied from an mRNA isolated from human leukocytes and coding for a protein of unknown function. The NH2-terminal sequence of the factor also showed extensive homology to that of the platelet factors beta-thromboglobulin (beta TG) and platelet factor 4 (PF-4). Studies done to identify the cell source of the factor revealed that it was produced by adherent mononuclear cells but not by platelets, while the opposite was true for beta TG.",

We isolated from this library a 1.6-kilobase full-length clone designated b4 whose corresponding mRNA was greatly increased in abundance in cytoplasmic RNA under these conditions. Dideoxy sequencing revealed that this mRNA encoded MONAP (monocyte-derived neutrophil-activating peptide), a 10-kilodalton monokine with neutrophil-specific chemotactic and enzyme-releasing activities. The 3' untranslated region of this mRNA was found to be 1.2 kilobases long and possessed nine copies of the AUUUA sequence known to be associated with regulation of mRNA stability. Actinomycin D chase experiments yielded evidence that cytoplasmic stabilization was one of the means of regulation of MONAP expression. Analysis of cytoplasmic poly(A)- RNA revealed the presence of several discrete truncated species that shared a common 5' end and appeared to be intermediates of degradation. S1 mapping showed that the 3' ends of these molecules were distributed throughout the 3' untranslated region, preferentially in A + U-rich regions, broadly correlating with the distribution of AUUUA sites. Nuclear run-on experiments indicated that transcriptional induction accounted for less than 15% of the accumulation of MONAP mRNA. This mRNA was induced in HL60 cells by treatment with several differentiation-inducing agents: 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-myristate alone, sodium butyrate, vitamin D3, and dimethyl sulfoxide.

        "Abstract": "γ-Tubulin plays a universal role in microtubule nucleation from microtubule organizing centers (MTOCs) such as the animal centrosome and fungal spindle pole body (SPB). γ-Tubulin functions as a multiprotein complex called the γ-tubulin complex (γ-TuC), consisting of GCP1-6 (GCP1 is γ-tubulin). In fungi and flies, it has been shown that GCP1-3 are core components, as they are indispensable for γ-TuC complex assembly and cell division, whereas the other three GCPs are not. Recently a novel conserved component, MOZART1, was identified in humans and plants, but its precise functions remain to be determined. In this paper, we characterize the fission yeast homologue Mzt1, showing that it is essential for cell viability. Mzt1 is present in approximately equal stoichiometry with Alp4/GCP2 and localizes to all the MTOCs, including the SPB and interphase and equatorial MTOCs. Temperature-sensitive mzt1 mutants display varying degrees of compromised microtubule organization, exhibiting multiple defects during both interphase and mitosis. Mzt1 is required for γ-TuC recruitment, but not sufficient to localize to the SPB, which depends on γ-TuC integrity. Intriguingly, the core γ-TuC assembles in the absence of Mzt1. Mzt1 therefore plays a unique role within the γ-TuC components in attachment of this complex to the major MTOC site.",

Sixteen recreational exercisers [female (50%)] (age = 25-48 years) with ≥ 1 unilateral permanent tattoo [median tattoo age = 6 years, IQR = 5] on the arm/torso completed an outdoor group fitness session. There were no significant differences between tattooed and non-tattooed skin for sweat EGF, IL-1α, IL-8, cortisol, glucose, BUN, or lactate concentrations. There were no significant differences between tattooed and non-tattooed skin for sweat EGF, IL-1α, IL-8, cortisol, glucose, BUN, or lactate excretion rate. Findings suggest that permanent tattoos older than 1 year may not impact local sweat EGF, IL-1α, IL-8, cortisol, glucose, BUN, and lactate concentrations or excretion rates during exercise.Clinical trial identifier NCT04920266 was registered on June 9, 2021.",

This cytokine has been proven to be identical with the recently characterized novel neutrophil-activating peptide NAP/IL-8. NAP/IL-8 is able to activate human PMNL for release of LTB4, omega-oxidized LTB4, and 5-HETE in the presence of exogenous AA. Half-maximal concentration of NAP/IL-8 for release of LTB4 has been found to be near 4 x 10(-8) mol/liter. Time course studies revealed rapid activation of PMNL, with maximal release of LTB4 within the first 10 min with a decline up to 40 min. High amounts of omega-oxidized LTB4 were detected up to that time. Significant amounts of AA-5-LO-products can be detected only when PMNL were stimulated with NAP/IL-8 in the presence of exogenous AA. The concentration of AA necessary for half-maximal LTB4 release has been found to be 3 x 10(-6) mol/liter. In the presence of 8 x 10(-9) mol/liter [3H]AA, NAP/IL-8 (10(-9) to 10(-7) mol/liter) did not induce the production of LTB4, omega-oxidized LTB4, or 5-HETE. In addition, PMNL prelabeled with [3H]AA did not release either [3H]AA or 5-lipoxygenase metabolites when stimulated with NAP/IL-8 (10(-9) to 10(-7) mol/liter), indicating that NAP/IL-8 apparently does not activate cellular phospholipases/diacylglycerol-lipases. Apart from FMLP, C5a, and PAF NAP/IL-8 is the fourth clearly characterized neutrophil chemotaxin able to activate the PMNL-5-lipoxygenase. The detection of large amounts of NAP/IL-8, arachidonic acid, as well as LTB4-like material, in lesional material of patients with psoriasis points towards a possibly important role of NAP/IL-8 in amplifying inflammatory processes by induction of LTB4-production.",

        "Abstract": "A chemotactic protein for polymorphonuclear leukocytes (lung carcinoma-derived chemotaxin [LUCT]) was purified from culture fluid of the human lung giant cell carcinoma LU65C cells to electrophoretically homogeneous form through five sequential purification steps: DEAE-Sepharose, CM-Sepharose, HPLC on carboxyl-methylated-polyvinylalcohol resin, hydrophobic, and reversed-phase. The molecular mass was determined as approximately 10 kD by SDS-PAGE and isoelectric point was 10.7. The chemotactic activity (ED50 0.75 x 10(-9) M) was sevenfold more potent than that of FMLP (5 X 10(-9) M) and comparable with that of C5a (10(-9) M). NH2-terminal amino acid sequence and amino acid composition of LUCT strongly suggest that it may be closely related to the putative protein encoded by the cDNA clone (3-10C) and almost identical with a part of sequence of the chemotactic factor derived from stimulated human leukocytes in the 6th to 32nd, but not the NH2-terminal 5 amino acids. These results indicate that the carcinoma cells produce LUCT without any added stimulant and suggest that the previously isolated chemotactic monokines may correspond to des(1-5) of LUCT in the NH2-terminal region.",
