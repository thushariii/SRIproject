        "Abstract": "We have recently described the purification and NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of a T cell-derived hybridoma growth factor that was provisionally designated interleukin-HP1 (IL-HP1). Here we report that a T cell supernatant containing high titers of this hybridoma growth factor considerably facilitated the establishment of primary cultures of murine plasmacytomas. Most plasmacytoma cell lines derived from such cultures remained permanently dependent on IL-HP1-containing T cell supernatant for both survival and growth in vitro. These cell lines, however, retained their ability to form tumors in irradiated pristane-treated mice. Analytical fractionation of a T cell supernatant rich in IL-HP1 by either gel filtration, isoelectric focusing, or reversed-phase HPLC revealed the existence of only one plasmacytoma growth factor activity that strictly copurified with IL-HP1, strongly suggesting the identity of both factors. This conclusion was further supported by the finding that IL-HP1 purified to homogeneity supported the growth of both B cell hybridomas and plasmacytomas. For half-maximal growth, plasmacytomas, however, required a concentration of IL-HP1 of approximately 30 pM, which is approximately 200 times higher than that required by B cell hybridomas. A clear difference in the specificity of IL-HP1 and B cell stimulatory factor 1 (BSF-1) was demonstrated by the finding that IL-HP1-dependent plasmacytomas did not survive in the presence of BSF-1, whereas helper T cell lines that proliferated in the presence of BSF-1 failed to respond to IL-HP1.",

        "Abstract": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a chronic condition caused by several factors including thermally oxidized tallow. Various strategies have been considered to ameliorate NAFLD. However, the role of milk thistle (MT) in ameliorating NAFLD caused by thermally oxidized tallow has not been reported. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the ability of milk thistle to protect rabbits from the toxicity of oxidized tallow (OT). The rabbits were given OT and an extract of MT. The composition of MT was analyzed using HPLC-DAD, and tallow samples were studied using GC-MS. The study also examined liver histology, antioxidant levels, liver-related inflammatory markers, and serum lipid profile. The results showed that the major components of the MT extract were silybin B, formononetin-glucuronic acid, proanthocyanidin B1, silychristin B, silydianin, and isosilybin A. The group given OT showed elevated lipid profiles, lower antioxidant status, higher levels of hepatic inflammatory markers, and lower levels of anti-inflammatory markers. This group also had higher fat storage in the liver compared to the control or treatment groups. However, when MT was supplemented, the pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-4, IL-6, and TNF-α) and antioxidant status (CAT, SOD, GSH-Px, GSH, and TBARS) of the liver returned to normal. This suggests that MT extract is an excellent source of hepatoprotective compounds. It protects the liver by increasing antioxidant enzymes, decreasing pro-inflammatory cytokines, and increasing anti-inflammatory markers.",

        "Abstract": "Microglia are natural immune cells in the central nervous system, and the activation of microglia is accompanied by a reprogramming of glucose metabolism. In our study, we investigated the role of long non-coding RNA taurine-upregulated gene 1 (TUG1) in regulating microglial glucose metabolism reprogramming and activation. BV2 cells were treated with Lipopolysaccharides (LPS)/Interferon-γ (IFN-γ) to establish a microglial activation model. The glycolysis inhibitor 2-Deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) was used as a control. The expression levels of TUG1 mRNA and proinflammatory cytokines such as Interleukin-1β (IL-1β), Interleukin -6, and Tumor Necrosis Factor-α mRNA and anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, Arginase 1(Arg1), CD206, and Ym1 were detected by RT-qPCR. TUG1 was silenced using TUG1 siRNA and knocked out using CRISPR/Cas9. The mRNA and protein expression levels of key enzymes involved in glucose metabolism, such as Hexokinase2, Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), Lactate dehydrogenase, Glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase, and Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), were determined by RT-qPCR and Western blotting. The glycolytic rate of microglial cells was measured using Seahorse. Differential metabolites were determined by metabolomics, and pathway enrichment was performed using these differential metabolites. Our findings revealed that the expression of TUG1 was elevated in proinflammatory-activated microglia and positively correlated with the levels of inflammatory factors. The expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, Arg1, CD206, and Ym1 were decreased when induced with LPS/IFN-γ. However, this decrease was reversed by the treatment with 2-DG. Silencing of GAPDH led to an increase in the expression of TUG1 and inflammatory factors. TUG1 knockout (TUG1KO) inhibited the expression of glycolytic key enzymes and promoted the expression of oxidative phosphorylation key enzymes, shifting the metabolic profile of activated microglia from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation. Additionally, TUG1KO reduced the accumulation of metabolites, facilitating the restoration of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and enhancing oxidative phosphorylation in microglia. Furthermore, the downregulation of TUG1 was found to reduce the expression of both proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines under normal conditions. Interestingly, when induced with LPS/IFN-γ, TUG1 downregulation showed a potentially beneficial effect on microglia in terms of inflammation. Downregulation of TUG1 expression inhibits glycolysis and facilitates the shift of microglial glucose metabolism from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation, promoting their transformation towards an anti-inflammatory phenotype and exerting anti-inflammatory effects in BV2.",

        "Abstract": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a chronic condition caused by several factors including thermally oxidized tallow. Various strategies have been considered to ameliorate NAFLD. However, the role of milk thistle (MT) in ameliorating NAFLD caused by thermally oxidized tallow has not been reported. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the ability of milk thistle to protect rabbits from the toxicity of oxidized tallow (OT). The rabbits were given OT and an extract of MT. The composition of MT was analyzed using HPLC-DAD, and tallow samples were studied using GC-MS. The study also examined liver histology, antioxidant levels, liver-related inflammatory markers, and serum lipid profile. The results showed that the major components of the MT extract were silybin B, formononetin-glucuronic acid, proanthocyanidin B1, silychristin B, silydianin, and isosilybin A. The group given OT showed elevated lipid profiles, lower antioxidant status, higher levels of hepatic inflammatory markers, and lower levels of anti-inflammatory markers. This group also had higher fat storage in the liver compared to the control or treatment groups. However, when MT was supplemented, the pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-4, IL-6, and TNF-α) and antioxidant status (CAT, SOD, GSH-Px, GSH, and TBARS) of the liver returned to normal. This suggests that MT extract is an excellent source of hepatoprotective compounds. It protects the liver by increasing antioxidant enzymes, decreasing pro-inflammatory cytokines, and increasing anti-inflammatory markers.",

The human cDNA contains a single open reading frame encoding a protein of 153 amino acid residues including a putative signal peptide. Amino acid sequences of the mouse and human polypeptides, deduced from their cDNAs, share extensive homology with the exception of about 40 amino acid residues near the middle portion, which share little homology.

        "Abstract": "A cDNA sequence coding for a human interleukin has been isolated from a concanavalin A-activated human T-cell cDNA library based on homology with a mouse interleukin cDNA that expresses B-cell stimulatory factor 1 (BSF-1) activity and T-cell- and mast-cell-stimulating activities. The human cDNA contains a single open reading frame encoding a protein of 153 amino acid residues including a putative signal peptide. Amino acid sequences of the mouse and human polypeptides, deduced from their cDNAs, share extensive homology with the exception of about 40 amino acid residues near the middle portion, which share little homology. Supernatant of COS-7 monkey cells transfected with the human cDNA clone stimulated proliferation of human helper T-cell clones and of anti-IgM-activated human B cells, two properties of mouse BSF-1 on mouse cells. These results indicate that this human cDNA clone encodes a protein structurally and functionally homologous to mouse BSF-1.",
