        "Abstract": "Transforming growth factor beta (Tgfb) is a well-studied pro-fibrotic cytokine, which upregulates cellular communication network factor 2 (Ccn2), collagen, and actin alpha 2, smooth muscle (Acta2) expression. Obesity induces adipose tissue fibrosis, which contributes to metabolic diseases. This work aimed to analyze the expression of Tgfb, Ccn2, collagen1a1 (Col1a1), Acta2 and BMP and activin membrane-bound inhibitor (Bambi), which is a negative regulator of Tgfb signaling, in different adipose tissue depots of mice fed a standard chow, mice fed a high fat diet (HFD) and ob/ob mice. Principally, these genes were low expressed in brown adipose tissues and this difference was less evident for the ob/ob mice. Ccn2 and Bambi protein as well as mRNA expression, and collagen1a1 mRNA were not induced in the adipose tissues upon HFD feeding whereas Tgfb and Acta2 mRNA increased in the white fat depots. Immunoblot analysis showed that Acta2 protein was higher in subcutaneous and perirenal fat of these mice. In the ob/ob mice, Ccn2 mRNA and Ccn2 protein were upregulated in the fat depots. Here, Tgfb, Acta2 and Col1a1 mRNA levels and serum Tgfb protein were increased. Acta2 protein was, however, not higher in subcutaneous and perirenal fat of these mice. Col6a1 mRNA was shown before to be higher in obese fat tissues. Current analysis proved the Col6a1 protein was induced in subcutaneous fat of HFD fed mice. Notably, Col6a1 was reduced in perirenal fat of ob/ob mice in comparison to the respective controls. 3T3-L1 cells express Ccn2 and Bambi protein, whose levels were not changed by fatty acids, leptin, lipopolysaccharide, tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-6. All of these factors led to higher Tgfb in 3T3-L1 adipocyte media but did not increase its mRNA levels. Free fatty acids induced necrosis whereas apoptosis did not occur in any of the in vitro incubations excluding cell death as a main reason for higher Tgfb in cell media. In summary, Tgfb mRNA is consistently induced in white fat tissues in obesity but this is not paralleled by a clear increase of its target genes. Moreover, discrepancies between mRNA and protein expression of Acta2 were observed. Adipocytes seemingly do not contribute to higher Tgfb mRNA levels in obesity. These cells release more Tgfb protein when challenged with obesity-related metabolites connecting metabolic dysfunction and fibrosis.",

Preclinical data suggest the involvement of the NLRP3/Inflammasome, receptor-interacting protein kinase-3 (RIPK3), and NRF2/oxidative pathways in the regulation of kidney inflammation. Cellular communication network factor 2 (CCN2, also called CTGF in the past) is an established fibrotic biomarker and a well-known mediator of kidney damage. CCN2 was shown to be involved in kidney damage through the regulation of proinflammatory and profibrotic responses. However, to date, the potential role of the NLRP3/RIPK3/NRF2 pathways in CCN2 actions has not been evaluated. In experimental acute kidney injury induced with folic acid in mice, CCN2 deficiency diminished renal inflammatory cell infiltration (monocytes/macrophages and T lymphocytes) as well as the upregulation of proinflammatory genes and the activation of NLRP3/Inflammasome-related components and specific cytokine products, such as IL-1β. Moreover, the NRF2/oxidative pathway was deregulated. Systemic administration of CCN2 to C57BL/6 mice induced kidney immune cell infiltration and activated the NLRP3 pathway. RIPK3 deficiency diminished the CCN2-induced renal upregulation of proinflammatory mediators and prevented NLRP3 modulation. These data suggest that CCN2 plays a fundamental role in sterile inflammation and acute kidney injury by modulating the RIKP3/NLRP3/NRF2 inflammatory pathways.",

        "Abstract": "The insulin-like growth factor (IGF) binding proteins (IGFBPs) modulate the actions of the insulin-like growth factors in endocrine, paracrine, and autocrine settings. Additionally, some IGFBPs appear to exhibit biological effects that are IGF independent. The six high-affinity IGFBPs that have been characterized to date exhibit 40-60% amino acid sequence identity overall, with the most conserved sequences in their NH2 and COOH termini. We have recently demonstrated that the product of the mac25/IGFBP-7 gene, which shows significant conservation in the NH2 terminus, including an \"IGFBP motif' (GCGCCXXC), exhibits low-affinity IGF binding. The closely related mammalian genes connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) gene, nov, and cyr61 encode secreted proteins that also contain the conserved sequences and IGFBP motifs in their NH2 termini. To ascertain if these genes, along with mac25/IGFBP-7, encode a family of low-affinity IGFBPs, we assessed the IGF binding characteristics of recombinant human CTGF (rhCTGF). The ability of baculovirus-synthesized rhCTGF to bind IGFs was demonstrated by Western ligand blotting, affinity cross-linking, and competitive affinity binding assays using 125I-labeled IGF-I or IGF-II and unlabeled IGFs. CTGF, like mac25/IGFBP-7, specifically binds IGFs, although with relatively low affinity. On the basis of these data, we propose that CTGF represents another member of the IGFBP family (IGFBP-8) and that the CTGF gene, mac25/IGFBP-7, nov, and cyr61 are members of a family of low-affinity IGFBP genes. These genes, along with those encoding the high-affinity IGFBPs 1-6, together constitute an IGFBP superfamily whose products function in IGF-dependent or IGF-independent modes to regulate normal and neoplastic cell growth.",
