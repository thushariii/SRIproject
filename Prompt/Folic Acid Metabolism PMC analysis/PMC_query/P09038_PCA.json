        "Abstract": "Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) made of repeating disaccharide units intricately engage with proteins, playing a crucial role in the spatial organization of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and the transduction of biological signals in cells to modulate a number of biochemical processes. Exploring protein-GAG interactions reveals several challenges for their analysis, namely, the highly charged and periodic nature of GAGs, their multipose binding, and the abundance of the interfacial water molecules in the protein-GAG complexes. Most of the studies on protein-GAG interactions are conducted using the TIP3P water model, and there are no data on the effect of various water models on the results obtained in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of protein-GAG complexes. Hence, it is essential to perform a systematic analysis of different water models in MD simulations for these systems. In this work, we aim to evaluate the properties of the protein-GAG complexes in MD simulations using different explicit: TIP3P, SPC/E, TIP4P, TIP4PEw, OPC, and TIP5P and implicit: IGB = 1, 2, 5, 7, and 8 water models to find out which of them are best suited to study the dynamics of protein-GAG complexes. The FF14SB and GLYCAM06 force fields were used for the proteins and GAGs, respectively. The interactions of several GAG types, such as heparin, chondroitin sulfate, and hyaluronic acid with basic fibroblast growth factor, cathepsin K, and CD44 receptor, respectively, are investigated. The observed variations in different descriptors used to study the binding in these complexes emphasize the relevance of the choice of water models for the MD simulation of these complexes.",

It is shown here that HBGF-2 stimulates cell-substratum adhesion and neurite extension in the sympathetic nerve cell line PC12. When HBGF-2 is adsorbed to artificial extracellular matrices consisting of heparin or chondroitin sulfate, it causes the formation of cellular aggregates or circles of cells, respectively. HBGF-2 is also a nerve cell survival molecule, for it potentiates the survival of primary cultures of embryonic chick ciliary ganglion cells but not of embryonic neural retina cells.
