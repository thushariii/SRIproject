The study involves in vitro experiments on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) to measure the expression of ICAM-1 in response to treatment with Aronia extracts. The extracts, particularly those rich in chlorogenic acids and anthocyanins, were found to suppress the surface expression of TNF-α-stimulated ICAM-1. This indicates a downregulation effect of the extracts on ICAM-1. The context of the healthcare scenario is the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis, as the suppression of ICAM-1 expression can reduce inflammation and leukocyte adhesion, which are critical in the development of atherosclerosis. The experimental weight is assigned as 2 (In Vitro) because the study was conducted using cell cultures in a controlled environment.",Chlorogenic acid,ICAM-1,Chlorogenic acid suppresses the surface expression of TNF-α-stimulated ICAM-1 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs).,"['Extracts containing mainly chlorogenic acid, i.e., without anthocyanins (no 1.1 and 1.2), suppressed the surface expression of the TNF-α-stimulated ICAM-1 by 1.31-fold and 1.27-fold, respectively (Figure 2a, 1.1; 1.2).']",Downregulation,Prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis by reducing inflammation and leukocyte adhesion.,2
